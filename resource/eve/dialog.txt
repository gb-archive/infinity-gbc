[INN_SLR    :Welcome to the traveler's inn!]
[INN_KSM    :Welcome, and may you find shade in our humble abode!]
[INN_COT    :Welcome to the Wayfarer's Rest.  We haven't had many customers, well, not since that flood that came from Turren a few months back.]
[INN_TUR    :It is cold and damp, but we have beds, if you need them.]
[INN_FAR    :Welcome to the Grand Palace, the greatest inn to be found in all the world!]
[INN_ALU    :There are few beds that the wounded don't need.  If you wish to rest, you may.]
[INN_ALU2   :Would you like to rest?]
[INN_SNO    :The hearth is warm and the tea is brewed strong.  You'll not find a finer resting place in all the range!]
[INN_TOS    :If you wish to rest here, you must pay a premium.  Just because my inn is gone does not mean I don't need to eat!]

[SLR_BOOK3A :A History of Selera]
[SLR_BOOK3B :The multi-tome history of the empire of Selera begins with the city's fabled founding by a prophet of God, moves through its renaming after the great sacrifice made by Selera for her people, and ends shortly after the sundering of the peace with Alutha.]
[SLR_BOOK4  :A children's tale about a world beneath the world, and the strange and various creatures that inhabit it.]

[SLR_STXT1  :I used to see lots of travelers come in here from all over the world and record their stories in the innkeeper's ledger.]

[SLR_STXT3  :Locked.]

[SLR_DTXT1  :I can't remember the last time I heard music...]
[SLR_DTXT2  :When I was a child, my parents told me I'd never see a day of war.  Now I wonder what to tell my own daughter.]
[SLR_DTXT3  :I go to the graveyard sometimes to talk to old friends.  Our long lives can seem like a curse at times.]
[SLR_DTXT4  :My mom says it's no longer safe to leave town!]
[SLR_DTXT5  :When Alutha killed the beloved Selera three hundred years ago, he showed that his people can never be trusted.]

[SLR2_DTXT3  :Oh, Connor, that look on your face!  Shouldn't it make you happy to be a knight again?]

[TGL_BOOK1A  :Canticle of the Earth]
[TGL_BOOK1B  :It is a song, hundreds of pages long, that in fact seems to have no end.  The hand that penned the first words is clearly different from that which penned the last.  The meaning of the song is unclear; in fact, the metaphors seem indecipherable.]
[TGL_DESK1   :It is a diary.  The entry to which it is open, which seems to be the last, reads, "Exhausted, as with every day.  The Soul Gem grants me life, but can never grant me the peace of death.  Eventually, it is my will, not my body, which shall collapse."]
[TGL_DESK2   :It is some massive tome, with the title 'Sefer Yezira' written in gilded letters upon its front.  The text is incomprehensible, as if written in some code or cipher.]


Various notes and tallies, on a monthly basis.  The numbers in one column have steadily decreased since 641, in another have steadily increased.  Perhaps this is some sort of population census.]

[TGL_STXT1  :Connor: We can't go back out there.  Not now.]
[TGL_STXT2  :The Soul Gem shines brightly.]
[TGL_STXT3  :Connor: This must be the passageway..]
[TGL_STXT4  :Never thought the great Sir Connor and his famous Engulf technique would need a lowly guard like me to bail him out!]

[TGL_DTXT1  :King Aldric awaits you in the throne room.]
[TGL_DTXT2  :You can find items in the strangest places.  Why, just recently I found an herb in a barrel!]
[TGL_DTXT3  :Speak to the Creator, if you doubt me.  You will find him in the basement of the north-east tower.  Look upon them, think upon them, and return to me at midnight.]
[TGL_DTXT4  :You heard His Majesty.]
[TGL_DTXT5  :I live to serve.]
[TGL_DTXT6  :No loitering in the main hall!]
[TGL_DTXT7  :I didn't fight in the last war, but God, the stories you hear...]
[TGL_DTXT8  :Hail King Aldric!]
[TGL_DTXT9  :Alutha is no match for us Selerans.]
[TGL_DTXT10 :I can't wait to see the Golem in action.  The Aluthans will fall.]
[TGL_DTXT11 :His Majesty will see you at midnight.  Please get some rest.]
[TGL_DTXT12 :This is the Royal Treasury.  You are not allowed here.]
[TGL_DTXT13 :Wha, wha? No, I wasn't sleeping! I'm on the lookout for spies!]

[NPS_STXT1  :Hmm..  I shouldn't go through here without a guide.]
[NPS_STXT2  :Connor: Kraith and his golem will be to the south.]
[NPS_STXT3  :Elya: I don't think we are ready to face them yet.]
[NPS_STXT4  :Connor: Hrm. Perhaps you're right.]

[KSM_BOOK1A :Empire of the Sands]
[KSM_BOOK1B :It is a historical treatise, though it seems more fictitious than factual, describing an ancient empire that ruled over this entire region, led by kings who worshipped the dead and drew great power from spirits.]
[KSM_DESK1A :Tales of the Shifting Sands]
[KSM_DESK1B :It is a book of many tales.  The tale to which to book is open describes a vizier, named Fassad, who seeks to conceal his numerous affairs by extending the length of the day itself.  It says that he traveled to a distant land, seeking the advice of a wadji of great power who lived in an ivory tower.  The wadji rejected the vizier's pleas for aid, and in fact transformed him into the gnomon of a huge sundial, to sweat forever in the hot desert sun.]
[KSM_DESK2A :There is a bit of simple verse written here.]
[KSM_DESK2B :The serpent slithers|   south to see|What sort of thing|   he seeks.|But in the east he|   spots the sun,|And sets his course|   at once.|Since east and south|   are in Kassim|Some day I'll send|   myself to see|The sort of secret|   that he's left.]

[KSM_DTXT1  :Kassim Oasis]
[KSM_DTXT2  :Dad says that the good thing about living in the desert is that no one ever bothers invading.]
[KSM_DTXT3  :Don't trust Hassan.  He sold me an old shoe for 2000 Aurum!]
[KSM_DTXT4  :Hassan told us that he owns the rights to the water in the oasis, because he is descended from the ancient rulers of our country.  I'm not sure I believe him...]
[KSM_DTXT5  :My mom told me that you can put out fire using water.]
[KSM_DTXT6  :A few weeks ago, the caverns became filled with monsters.]
[KSM_DTXT7  :My son spotted a werewolf around here.  I'd be careful if I were you.]
[KSM_DTXT8  :I saw it!  I saw it!  It was part man and part wolf.  I want to be like that when I grow up.]
[KSM_DTXT9  :Long ago, powerful Djinni were trapped inside Gems by an ancient sultan.  These Gems are very rare, but contain unimaginable power!]
[KSM_DTXT10 :Welcome to my item shop, effendi!]
[KSM_DTXT11 :Need some weapons?]

[FRC_STXT1  :Connor: I can't get around this flame, it's too hot.]
[FRC_STXT2  :Connor: I think this should solve the problem.]
[FRC_STXT3  :* Connor uses Water on the flame *]
[FRC_STXT4  :Connor: Easily done.]

[TUR_STXT1  :A deep, dark well.]
[TUR_STXT2  :Dead.  And he seems to have been chewed on.]
[TUR_STXT3  :Connor: Look out!]
[TUR_STXT4  :Welcome to Turren.]
[TUR_STXT5  :Connor: Look, Elya, a rope!  Shall we climb down?]

[TUR_DTXT1  :There is a curse of God coming to us.  What are we to do?]
[TUR_DTXT2  :Anyone can become lycanthropic.  Contrary to popular belief, biting is not the only way it can spread.]
[TUR_DTXT3  :You'll never make it through the Great Wood alive without a Pathfinder.]
[TUR_DTXT4  :This is Victor, the famous Pathfinder.]
[TUR_DTXT5  :Everyone is turning into a werewolf...  I'm so scared...]
[TUR_DTXT6  :Lycanthropy causes a person to turn into a wolf.  Believe me, I study it every day.  You should not stay around too long.]
[TUR_DTXT7  :Our resources are running out here, I'm afraid.  These weapons will cost you much.]
[TUR_DTXT8  :Need some items?]
[TUR_DTXT9  :Be careful with Victor.  He is still not well.]

[TUR_STXT6  :Mayor: Leave this doomed place.]
[TUR_STXT7  :Connor: What's happening here?]
[TUR_STXT8  :Mayor: We have been punished.]
[TUR_STXT9  :Elya: By who?  For what?]
[TUR_STXT10 :Mayor: I don't know, I don't know...]
[TUR_STXT11 :Connor: We need to pass through the Great Wood.]
[TUR_STXT12 :Mayor: You're cursed too, then.  Our only living Pathfinder is afflicted by lycanthropy.]
[TUR_STXT13 :Elya: Can we see him?]
[TUR_STXT14 :Mayor: Do whatever you wish, we're all doomed...]
[TUR_STXT15 :Connor: Thank you.]
[TUR_STXT16 :Mayor: Th...thank you?  I haven't heard that in a long time.  Take this with you, and be welcome.]
[TUR_STXT17 :You cannot enter, he is too ill for visitors.]
[TUR_STXT18 :The Mayor said you could enter?  Go in then, but don't disturb him.]

[GRW_STXT1  :Victor: We must pass by two flower beds to get to Holbrooke.]
[GRW_STXT2  :Victor: I hear the song.]
[GRW_STXT3  :Victor: That way.]
[GRW_STXT4  :Victor: The song...]

[GRW_STXT5  :Victor: I refuse to be in this place.]

[HOL_BOOK1A :A book of children's songs is here, seemingly out of place for a weaponshop.  The book falls open to an old nursery rhyme.]
[HOL_BOOK1B :"We danced for joy, we danced for life / around the flowers, upon the fields / In times of peace, in times of strife, / We danced for love that never yields."]

[HOL_STXT1  :Welcome to Holbrooke]
[HOL_STXT2  :It's all dried up.]
[HOL_STXT3  :There is no flesh at all left on the bones.]
[HOL_STXT4  :Let this be a warning!]

[HOL_ETXT1  :Spend the night?]
[HOL_ETXT2  :Connor: I'm sure Ryan would be happy.]
[HOL_ETXT3  :Elya: Who?]
[HOL_ETXT4  :Connor: Nothing.  I suppose we should rest before we press on.]
[HOL_ETXT5  :Elya: The dead will forgive us.]

[SEW_STXT1  :Connor: We cannot go back..  We must press onward.]
[SEW_STXT2  :* Pressed the switch *]

[SEW_STXT3  :There is something carved onto the surface of this box.]
[SEW_STXT4  :There is something carved onto the surface of this barrel.]
[SEW_STXT5  :Supplies are running out, and I fear we cannot stay much longer.  The wizard who held us captive will come searching soon, and will surely kill us all.]
[SEW_STXT6  :We must try to escape, yet the hideous knife-wielding denizens of this cavern may be the death of us.]
[SEW_STXT7  :They fear only clean water, and we have little enough of it as is.  Tonight we will try.  God have mercy on us if we fail.]

[SEW_STXT8  :Victor: I smell rot, be careful.]
[SEW_STXT9  :Elya: Watch out!]

[DUR_STXT1  :Guard: None shall pass.]
[DUR_STXT2  :Connor: Huh?]
[DUR_STXT3  :Guard: None shall pass!]
[DUR_STXT4  :Connor: Oh well..]
[DUR_STXT5  :Elya: Follow him, Connor.  It is your fate.  God be with you.]
[DUR_STXT6  :Victor: What choice is there?  We're surrounded.]

[DUR_DTXT1  :Seleran dog, bow before your conquerors!]
[DUR_DTXT2  :The Selerans will fall.  The Geist Cannon will destroy all of them.]
[DUR_DTXT3  :You don't stand a chance.]
[DUR_DTXT4  :Our soldiers are in much better shape than you Selerans.]
[DUR_DTXT5  :Mmm.. and some bread too.]
[DUR_DTXT6  :You don't think you can beat us, do you?]
[DUR_DTXT7  :Take the stairs to see our ultimate weapon.  Victory is ours.]

[ALT_STXT1  :Welcome to Alutha Town]
[ALT_STXT2  :A statue of an Aluthan soldier.]
[ALT_STXT3  :Locked.]

[FAR_STXT1  :Welcome to Fairport]
[FAR_BOOK1A :The Doom of Sunken Pete]
[FAR_BOOK1B :This book tells of the adventures of a captain captured by mermaids.  Apparently he seduces their beautiful mermaid princess, Altantea, and saves their civilization from a giant creature called the Kraken by imprisoning it in an ancient temple.  It seems that these mermaids aren't the standard, blast-you-with -lightning-for-laughs variety.]
[FAR_BOOK2A :Nautical Trade Practices]
[FAR_BOOK2B :A surprisingly exciting book that details the methods and techniques of a famous merchant, Pierre LeFrande, with numerous charts and diagrams illustrating basic economic principles.]
[FAR_BOOK2C :Well, maybe not surprising or exciting, but still very detailed.]
[FAR_BOOK3A :A History of Fairport]
[FAR_BOOK3B :It seems to be a history of Fairport and its leading citizens.  The Gurdswythe family seems to have dominated the town for many centuries.]
[FAR_BOOK4A :The Gears of Time]
[FAR_BOOK4B :This series of books seems to occupy the entire bookcase, and apparently is still not finished.  Perhaps if you had neither literary taste nor anything to do with your life, you would be able to read them all.]
[FAR_BOOK5A :Captain's Cowardly]
[FAR_BOOK5B :An adventure story about a young sailor marooned on an island, and the ways in which he backstabs, betrays, and generally confounds the lives of his crewmates.  Seems like the kind of thing Ryan would like.]
[FAR_DESK1A :Olde Sea Shanteys]
[FAR_DESK1B :A page is dog-eared.  It reads:]
[FAR_DESK1C :One is the switch that ya flip in the mornin']
[FAR_DESK1D :Three is the switch that ya flip in the noontime]
[FAR_DESK1E :Six is the one that you do in the evenin']
[FAR_DESK1F :If you wanna see him!]
[FAR_DESK2  :It seems to be a book of shipping routes and transit times, open to a page listing Selera.]

[FAR_BOOK6  :The cartography of a great explorer named Caius Argorus, who claimed to have discovered a land beyond the great seas, peopled by folk of different custom and appearance.  The charts are time-worn and almost impossible to read, and would be useless for any form of navigation.]
[FAR_BOOK7A :A children's story called "The Song of Eliandra."]
[FAR_BOOK7B :It tells of a beautiful woman who, fleeing pursuit by an unwanted suitor, escaped into a forest.  When she was surrounded by the suitor and his servants, she prayed to God for protection, and was transformed into a great and dignified tree.  It is said that her song calls out to unhappy souls, and comforts them in their time of need.]
[FAR_BOOK8  :A wide variety of popular novels are here for the perusal of those staying in the inn.  Most of them feature luridly painted covers depicting swashbuckling heroes with misproportioned females hanging on their arms.]
[FAR_BOOK9  :Aside from diagrams of various weapons and suits of armor, there is a single, leather-bound text describing a fabled race called the niebelung, who were said to have forged a weapon of incomparable virtue.]
[FAR_BOOK10A:How to Succeed in Shipping Without Really Trying]
[FAR_BOOK10B:The book seems partial to techniques such as price fixing and forcibly removing the competition, and its conception of the "common man" seems to consider sloth and idiocy inherent qualities.]
[FAR_BOOK11A:Eastern Secrets for Married Couples.]
[FAR_BOOK11B:Probably not a good idea to look through this.]

[FAR_DTXT1:Welcome to what was once Fairport.  Now we don't have a port, and things aren't so fair any more.]
[FAR_DTXT2:Argh.  I was once a captain, now I'm just a landlubber like the rest of ye!]
[FAR_DTXT3:Without trade, prices have soared.]
[FAR_DTXT4:So what if your city was destroyed?  We have problems of our own here.]
[FAR_DTXT5:No fish to eat, no ships to see in the harbor...]
[FAR_DTXT6:My father was drowned when Green Mask sunk his ship.]
[FAR_DTXT7:That knave Green Mask!  If I had my ship, I'd hunt him down!]
***
[FAR_DTXT8:You'd think this...tea...would make my troubles go away.  All it does is keep me up at night.]
[FAR_DTXT9:That fool over there calls himself "Soy."  What kind of a name is that?]
[FAR_DTXT10:If you can bear to drink this tea, it's good for what ails you.  Even the stout loggers from the countryside tell me so.  Call me a genius.]
***Those all go in a bar***
[FAR_DTXT11:My husband spends all his time at the bar.]
[FAR_DTXT12:I have no husband, just a poor boy who dreams of revenge.]
***Those all go in two houses.***
[FAR_DTXT13:I hope we get our boats back soon.  Without trade, I may not be able to afford this place!]
[FAR_DTXT14:You people look very happy.  It's not so happy here though.]
***These go in the mansion ***
[FAR_DTXT15:I must apologize, but all the weapon shipments for months have been seized by Green Mask and his pirate band!]
[FAR_DTXT16:I'm sorry, our goods are extremely expensive.  The laws of supply and demand bind me just as much as they do anyone else!]
***These go in the shops ***

[FAR2_DTXT1:We've got our ships.  Come Hell or high-water, we'll ride it out.]
[FAR2_DTXT2:You'd think after we got all the boats back, you'd see one in harbor...  Oh well, they must all be out at sea.]
[FAR2_DTXT3:Prices are down, supplies are in, and all the men have their boats back.  At last they'll stop complaining!]
Captain replaced by a normal townsperson [FAR2_DTXT4:I've come here to get away from war, and maybe get some sun while I'm at it.]
Captain replaced by a normal townsperson[FAR2_DTXT5:Now that shipping is running again, I'm managing quite a little merchant empire.]
[FAR2_DTXT6:My father is still gone, but no one here remembers what's happened.]
[FAR2_DTXT7:I never thought the boats would be returned, but we here in Fairport have a saying: "No matter how bad the storm, it always has its end."]
***
[FAR2_DTXT8:I thought I would be able to leave now that I have my ship, but I can't.  Every morning, I wake up and just come here.  What else is left for me in the world?]
[FAR2_DTXT9:Some day, MY ship will come in, and when it does, I'll be ready.  Until then, bottoms up!]
[FAR2_DTXT10:If you can bear to drink this tea, it's good for what ails you.  Even the stout loggers from the countryside tell me so.  Call me a genius.]
***Those all go in a bar***
[FAR2_DTXT11:My husband spends all his time at the bar.]
[FAR2_DTXT12:My son spends all day watching the ocean, waiting for his father to return.  How can I explain this all to him?]
***Those all go in two houses.***
[FAR2_DTXT13:Our boats are back, but without Green Mask to ensure my success...that is...heh heh heh.  You didn't hear a thing!]
[FAR2_DTXT14:You people look very happy.  It's not so happy here though.]
***These go in the mansion ***
[FAR2_DTXT15:Welcome to the weapon shop.  How may I help you?]
[FAR2_DTXT16:Welcome to the item shop.  How may I help you?]
***These go in the shops ***


[SNO_STXT1  :Raaawrrr!]
[SNO_STXT2  :Beware of blizzards, falling rocks, and Mountain Yetis]
[SNO_BOOK1A :There is a thin book in this bookcase, and it looks worn from much reading.  The title on the spine is faded, but is legible all the same as "The Allegory of the Rose."]
[SNO_BOOK1B :It tells of a wandering sorcerer who bestowed a mystical rosebush upon great Empress Evelain, as a reflection of her generosity and kindness.  Each day, she would pass by, plucking from it the fairest of the red roses on the bush.  By the next day, through means of some hidden virtue, a new blossom would grow to take its place, just as fair as the most beautiful rose remaining on the bush.  Yet with each day, the Empress's roses grew less pleasing to the eye, thornier, and paler and sickly.]
[SNO_BOOK1C :Still she took the finest of the bunch, and the spell upon the bush could do nothing but create another twisted flower.  In the end, the Empress summoned the mighty sorcerer who had brought the gift, and insisted that he repair what had come to pass.  He explained what had happened, and that there was nothing he could do.  Furious, Evelain had him slain, so that his blood restored the crimson hue to the flowers, and left the bush and the body forever as a warning to those who would trifle with the wills of the mighty.]
[SNO_BOOK2A :Nestled amongst bestiaries and herbals is a tome entitled, "Farmer, Warrior, Prince."]
[SNO_BOOK2B :It is a long-winded and didactic biography of Alutha, tracing him from his roots as a peasant farmer in the northern steppes to a conscripted soldier in the war versus the Unnamed, and concluding with his return to his people and his short-lived rule over them.]

[ALU_BOOK1A :This bookcase holds only The Litany of Rememberance.]
[ALU_BOOK1B :"Remember that Alutha gave up all: life, honor, love.  Remember that beside him Selera and Gilus gave up no less.  Remember that we must honor their sacrifices by making sacrifices no less great.  Remember that duty comes before pleasure.  Remember that death comes before dishonor."]
[ALU_STXT1  :The dead should be allowed to rest in peace.]

[ALU_DTXT1:Death before dishonor.]
[ALU_DTXT2:Death before dishonor.]
[ALU_DTXT3:By the God, I'll water the ground red before I'll let Alutha fall!]
[ALU_DTXT4:The Selerans call us barbarians, but we aren't.  Our ways are different from theirs, but no less honorable.]
[ALU_DTXT5:My wife is my shield maiden.  If I fall, she will avenge me.]
[ALU_DTXT6:It would take something powerful to send my husband Kursk below!]
[ALU_DTXT7:Alutha is a castle and a city.  We held against the Selerans for two years before we fell.  If these creatures think they'll find us easy prey, they're fools!]
[ALU_DTXT8:You should take a rest.  What do you say?]
[ALU_DTXT9:I chose to stay at home rather than be a shield maiden.  I think that's very modern, don't you?]
[ALU_DTXT10:I'm afraid for my mom and dad.]
[ALU_DTXT11:The king's chambers lie beyond.]
[ALU_DTXT12:The king's chambers lie beyond.]
[ALU_DTXT13:From here, I can see any foe that dares approach.]
[ALU_DTXT14:Cursed stone creatures wounded me...]
[ALU_DTXT15:I'm so tired of war, but honor insists and I yield to it.]
[ALU_DTXT16:The golem can rip a man limb from limb...I'm terrified.]
[ALU_DTXT17:What if we're not so lucky next time?]
[ALU_DTXT18:Need some weapons?]
[ALU_DTXT19:King: Good luck against Kraith.]

[ALU2_DTXT1:So Kraith wants battle.  So be it.]
[ALU2_DTXT2:I have no fear of golem or any other monster!]
[ALU2_DTXT3:By the God, I'll water the ground red before I'll let Alutha fall!]
[ALU2_DTXT4:I wish these wars would end.]
[ALU2_DTXT5:My wife is my shield maiden.  If I fall, she will avenge me.]
[ALU2_DTXT6:It would take something powerful to send my husband Kursk below!]
[ALU2_DTXT7:Alutha is a castle and a city.  We held against the Selerans for two years before we fell.  If these creatures think they'll find us easy prey, they're fools!]
[ALU2_DTXT8:You should take a rest.  What do you say?]
[ALU2_DTXT9:I wonder if I should have trained to be a warrior...]
[ALU2_DTXT10:I'm afraid for my mom and dad.]
[ALU2_DTXT11:If it's war he wants, it's war he'll get.]
[ALU2_DTXT12:Some day, I want to raise a family and lay down my weapons.  But first, I have killing to do.]
[ALU2_DTXT13:When they come, I'll know it.]
[ALU2_DTXT14:I must heal, so that I can fight once more!]
[ALU2_DTXT15:I'm so tired of war, but honor insists and I yield to it.]
[ALU2_DTXT16:They're going to kill us...]
[ALU2_DTXT17:Alutha shall stand as a light shining in the darkness.]
[ALU2_DTXT18:Need some weapons?]
[ALU2_DTXT19:King: Good luck against Kraith.]

[ALU3_DTXT1:I used to dream of growing old.  Now, I suspect that will be my final fantasy.]
[ALU3_DTXT2:Food is running low, but spirits are high.  Trust in us to hold out till the end.]
[ALU3_DTXT3:By the God, I'll water the ground red before I'll let Alutha fall!]
[ALU3_DTXT4:I wish these wars would end.]
[ALU3_DTXT5:My wife is my shield maiden.  If I fall, she will avenge me.]
[ALU3_DTXT6:It would take something powerful to send my husband Kursk below!]
[ALU3_DTXT7:We need food and fresh water, desperately, but we dare not leave the castle.]
[ALU3_DTXT8:You should take a rest.  What do you say?]
[ALU3_DTXT9:I wonder if I should have trained to be a warrior...]
[ALU3_DTXT10:Maybe I can find some roots to eat in the courtyard.]
[ALU3_DTXT11:Even the tallest cliffs crumble eventually.]
[ALU3_DTXT12:Bah, my partner is a pessimist.]
[ALU3_DTXT13:I'm so hungry.]
[ALU3_DTXT14:I saw a flash of light in the south, as if something were emerging from the ice.]
[ALU3_DTXT15:A sword only looks beautiful because blood washes off iron easily.  A soul is a much harder thing to cleanse.]
[ALU3_DTXT16:So...hungry...]
[ALU3_DTXT17:These are hard walls, and harder people.  I will see to it that we survive.]
[ALU3_DTXT18:Need some weapons?]
[ALU3_DTXT19:King: Good luck against Kraith.]


[MAG_BOOK1 :The personal research of the ArchMage, delving into elementalism and temporal manipulation.]

[MAG_LIB1A :The Cult of the Sacred Flame]
[MAG_LIB1B :It is a dusty tome describing an old sect of the Magi, which was purged and driven from the Tower, who believed that all mankind was part of a cosmic plan which bound them to specific roles in an ordered society.]

[MAG_LIB2A :The Gilean Codex]
[MAG_LIB2B :Within this single, huge volume are all the laws and precepts laid down by the archmage Gilus.  It deals extensively with the commandment against the creation of life, and with restrictions on worship of the elements or other heresies.]

[MAG_LIB3  :It seems someone has filled this bookcase with trashy novels.  The majority of them appear to be part of a series called simply "The Chronicler."]

[MAG_LIB4A :A Brief History of Magic, Part I]
[MAG_LIB4B :This traces the existence of magic from its creation in the Great Effulsion to its physical manifestation in the prophet Amintakhesa.]

[MAG_LIB5A :A Brief History of Magic, Part II]
[MAG_LIB5B :This continuation of the massive history tells of the foundation of the Tower, the struggle of the orders -- in which the cultists and their archons were driven forth to forever leave the realms of men -- and the ascendance of Gilus, the first true archmage.]

[MAG_LIB6A :A Brief History of Magic, Part III]
[MAG_LIB6B :In this conclusion, the history deals with the Period of Mourning following the death of Gilus at the hands of Alutha, the slow and steady decline in numbers of magi, and even recent events concerning the rogue wizard, Kraith.  It appears to be incomplete.]

[MAG_LIB7A :Tinctures and Ungents: A Compendium]
[MAG_LIB7B :Everything from curing warts to stirring the libido.  Many sections have hand-written notes in the margin.]

[MAG_LIB8A :A Treatise on the Unnamed]
[MAG_LIB8B :A very scholarly examination of the coming of the Unnamed and the havoc he wrecked upon the world.  Apparently, fully two-thirds of the world's population was wiped out in the great wars against his demonic hordes.  The author seems unclear on where the Unnamed came from, describing his home as "outside of space and time."]

[MAG_LIB9A :Ether and Matter]
[MAG_LIB9B :Though many passages have been excised from this book, it is clear that the topic is a theory that all things can be divided into two distinct substances: ether and matter.  The book posits that magi have a disproportionate amount of ether within them, thus gifting them with great powers.]

[MAG_LIB10A:List of Masters]
[MAG_LIB10B:It is a single vellum scroll of phenomenal length.  Hundreds of names, some more faded than others, run the length of the scroll, though there is plenty of space below for additional names.  Beside the names are three dates, though more recent masters have only two.]

[MAG_LIB11A:The Myth of the Djinni]
[MAG_LIB11B:This lengthy and expansive essay deals with the evolution of the myth of the djinni, and explains how it evolved out of superstitions involving the great magical power of the certain gemstones.  The author states that the gems in fact derive their power from the ancient heroes themselves: Gilus, Selera, and the traitor Alutha.  Before venturing into the Great Dark, Gilus bound the strength of the heroes to various impotent stones, so that if anything should befall them, their powers might be gathered by other warriors brave enough to face the Unnamed.  The author believes that this binding of their powers to the stones may have given rise to the belief that spirits inhabited the gems.]

[MAG_LIB12A:Inquest into the Affairs of Alutha and Selera]
[MAG_LIB12B:These appear to be notes taken by various spies sent to the nations of Alutha and Selera.  They catalogue the events of the Great War between the two countries in 638, including the so-called Massacre at Durgardt.  It continues with the virulent plagues of 641 and 642, and even contains figures concerning the build-up of Aluthan troops from 649 to the present.]

[MAG_LIB13A:Notes for Review]
[MAG_LIB13B:Apprentices over the years have compiled their notes to help future students.  Most are cryptic and incomprehensible to the uninitiated;  however, one scroll describes the importance of stocking up on magical restoratives before venturing into the final Trials.]

[MAG_LIB14A:Record of Proscriptions]
[MAG_LIB14B:This scroll contains a list of names -- most of the early ones are marked as "Cult Heretics" -- which have been crossed out.  At the bottom of the list are two names: Gutana and Kraith.]

[MAG_LIB15A:The Gathering]
[MAG_LIB15B:This appears to be the journal of a deranged wizard of some sort, who vowed that he would be able to defeat all the others if only he had the aurum to buy better cards.]

[MAG_LIB16A:Greater and Lesser Gems]
[MAG_LIB16B:A study of the creation of magical receptacles, specifically the use of gemstones to store magical energies over long periods of time.  The author refers to three types of these gems: the Greatest Gem, or the Soul Gem, as the Selerans call it, which has the power to extend life, augment magical potential, and provide clairvoyance; the Greater Gems, which were sealed by Gilus in the Three Temples before his battle against the Unnamed; and the Lesser Gems, created by the earlier ArchMages, which have been lost over time.  Of them, only the Carnelian gemstone remains in the possession of the magi.]

[MAG_LIB17A:The Semiotics of Magic]
[MAG_LIB17B:A study of magical vernacular, with the specific interest in the use of such phrases as "Abracadabra" and "Shazzam!"  It seems like the author has had tenure as a full Master for quite some time.]

[MAG_LIB18A:Elemental Qualities]
[MAG_LIB18B:In this carefully worded treatise, a Master Mage seeks to examine the relation of the four primal elements to living organisms.  He notes that many creatures, particularly monsters spawned during the war against the Unnamed, seem to possess high levels of tolerance to certain elemental attacks, while relatively low levels of tolerance to others.  The author footnotes a reference to an old myth that describes the dreaded Kraken as being afraid only of lightning, and also cites the weakness of certain woodland creatures against flames.]

[MAG_LIB19A:Here Be Dragons]
[MAG_LIB19B:A history of the search for the mythical draconian creatures.  The author is highly skeptical, pointing out that every region in which dragons were identified as living was historically inaccessable, thus casting doubt on the existance of the beasts.  He does, however, note that several bones of immense size have been unearthed, perhaps lending credence to ancient legends.]

[MAG_LIB20A:Encyclopedia Monstrum]
[MAG_LIB20B:A grand survey of various monsters studied since the war against the Unnamed.  Though most of the information seems commonsensical, and somewhat out of date, the tome tries to trace the development of these creatures, their migrations, and evolutions.  It comes to the conclusion that there is a degradation of monsters as they leave their traditional strongholds, as if the more powerful creatures drove the weaker ones out.]

[MAG_LIB21A:Metamorphoses]
[MAG_LIB21B:This entire bookcase is filled with studies of transformations and transmutations, both magically documents and mythically described.  It comes to the conclusion that most of the mythical transformations, such as the fables "The Song of Eliandra" and "The Petrification of the Devout Smith" are didactic metaphors, not true stories.]


[MAG_STXT1:This is the Magi Treasury.]
[MAG_STXT2:Connor: I believe in you, Elya.]
[MAG_STXT3:Ryan: I don't know why you're doing this, but good luck.]
[MAG_STXT4:Victor: Don't die, I'm counting on you to get me back to normal.]

[MAG_DTXT1:The circle shows us that the beginning devours the end and gives it birth.  Thus, all things that are coming to the end are in reality only coming to their beginning.  We shouldn't fear death, but embrace it.]
[MAG_DTXT2:If no apprentice can pass the test, what will become of our people?  You're our only hope, Elya!]
[MAG_DTXT3:No weapon could have caused what we felt.  I'm sure you're wrong about this "Geist Cannon."]
[MAG_DTXT4:When I work magic, I feel so tired.  I wonder whether I should pass beyond?]
[MAG_DTXT5:You've returned?  It's a miracle!]
[MAG_DTXT6:My young girl, it's good to see you again.  The Archmage will want to hear what has happened.  He is in his study up above.]
[MAG_DTXT7:The more I study the world, the more complex it becomes.  Sometimes you need to step back and see the big picture...]
[MAG_DTXT8:We've all become specialists, even him!  Don't listen to him!]
[MAG_DTXT9:Back when I was a magus, we studied |every| art, not just the ones we wanted to.  What a state education has fallen into!]
[MAG_DTXT10:Elya!  It's a pleasure to see you, magus.]

[MAG2_DTXT1:The test will show you the truth.  Remember that destiny controls us.  To think that we control our own fates is to struggle upstream.]
[MAG2_DTXT2:I have faith in you, Elya.]
[MAG2_DTXT3:If my apprentice Mikhail couldn't pass the test, why should you think you can?  What, you can read AND write?  Maybe you have a chance!]
[MAG2_DTXT4:Remember, your eyes may deceive you.]
[MAG2_DTXT5:Be careful, apprentice.]
[MAG2_DTXT6:Enemies within the Trials are not real, but they can kill you nonetheless.]
[MAG2_DTXT7:Things within the Trials seem puzzling, but in reality, they are quite simple.]
[MAG2_DTXT8:God protect you.]
[MAG2_DTXT9:Don't waste energy, and be sure to replenish yourself when you can.]
[MAG2_DTXT10:God watch over you.]

[MAG3_DTXT1:Victory comes not from conquering others, but from conquering the weakness within yourself.  Defeat comes not from external circumstances, but internal disorder.  Remember that, and you will never fall.]
[MAG3_DTXT2:By God, I knew you could do it!]
[MAG3_DTXT3:In...in...incredible!]
[MAG3_DTXT4:We are blessed with another Mage!]
[MAG3_DTXT5:A woman master...who ever would have thought?]
[MAG3_DTXT6:Hahaha, I told them you'd succeed!]
[MAG3_DTXT7:Now you can devote your life to research.]
[MAG3_DTXT8:It's better to teach than to become a bookworm.]
[MAG3_DTXT9:With the lower standards we have now, it's no wonder you could pass so easily.]
[MAG3_DTXT10:Well done, Master.]

[JOY1_BOOK1  :A book of poetry, ending with the poem, "The Great Expanse."]
[JOY1_DTXT1  :It's so peaceful here.  Every day is filled with the sound of songbirds.]
[JOY1_DTXT2  :Where are we?  What do you mean?  We're in Selera!]
[JOY1_DTXT3  :Connor!  I'm so glad to see you're finally here.]
[JOY1_DTXT4  :When I grow up, I want to be a hero just like you!]
[JOY1_DTXT5  :Aren't these flowers beautiful?]
[JOY1_DTXT6  :My life is perfect.]
[JOY1_DTXT7  :I will stay with Lianna forever.]
[JOY1_DTXT8  :Connor!  What a pleasant surprise!]
[JOY1_DTXT9  :Anna baked me cookies.  She's the best!]
[JOY1_DTXT10 :Connor...you deserve this moment.]
[JOY1_DTXT11 :I'm glad you're finally here.]

[JOY1B_DTXT1  :What's...what's...happening?  All I hear is silence...]
[JOY1B_DTXT2  :Something terrible is coming...]
[JOY1B_DTXT3  :I feel so cold!]
[JOY1B_DTXT4  :I'm scared!  Help us!]
[JOY1B_DTXT5  :This has never happened before!]
[JOY1B_DTXT6  :This can't be happening!]
[JOY1B_DTXT7  :No...]
[JOY1B_DTXT8  :Connor!  Help us!]
[JOY1B_DTXT9  :I'm scared...Mommy!]
[JOY1B_DTXT10 :Connor, be careful! Something is wrong!]
[JOY1B_DTXT11 :What's going on?  When I close my eyes, I hear screaming.]

[JOY2_STXT1  :Who's the other boy with you, Roland?  He looks nice.]
[JOY2_DTXT1  :The guard twiches, as if he is in a nightmare.]
[JOY2_DTXT2  :You!  Who are you, go away!]


[S1_ETXT1   :Connor: Anna?  Anna...  Is that you?]
[S1_ETXT2   :Connor: No one bothers me any more.  Who could it be?]
[S1_ETXT3   :Connor: Who is it?]
[S1_ETXT4   :Voice: Open in the name of the King!]
[S1_ETXT5   :Connor: Just come in and get it over with.]
[S1_ETXT6   :Guard: Sir Connor...]
[S1_ETXT7   :Connor: SIR Connor?  You're mistaken.  I'm just plain, old, common Connor now.]
[S1_ETXT8   :Guard: Sir Connor, in the name of King Aldric, guardian of Selera, beloved of God, I have come here to summon you to Tagel Castle.]
[S1_ETXT9   :Connor: Tell Aldric there is no Sir Connor here.  Not any more.]
[S1_ETXT10  :Guard: Failure to obey a summons is treason, Sir Connor.]
[S1_ETXT11  :Connor: Is that what it has come to then?  Very well.]
[S1_ETXT12  :Guard: His majesty will receive you in the throne room.  Take this sword with you.]
[S1_ETXT13  :Connor: SIR Connor.  Hah.]

[S2_ETXT1   :Connor: Anna...]
[S2_ETXT2   :Be sure to remember those who have passed away.  We are in their debt.]
[S2_ETXT3   :Woman: ...]

[S3_ETXT1   :Connor: What a curious statue.]

[S4_ETXTA   :Connor: I'd better go see the king.]
[S4_ETXT1   :Aldric: So you have come, Connor.  I am glad.]
[S4_ETXT2   :Connor: "A failure to obey a summons is treason," my liege.]
[S4_ETXT3   :Aldric: Ah, and the request of an old friend means nothing?]
[S4_ETXT4   :Connor: Your age is unimportant, your friendship non-existant.]
[S4_ETXT5   :Connor: It was by your will that I am Connor merely, by your will that I have been shamed.]
[S4_ETXT6   :Connor: You did not stand by me when my wife died, but looked down on me.]
[S4_ETXT7   :Connor: I am here, King Aldric, because if I were not, I can only wonder what new torment you would lay upon me.]
[S4_ETXT8   :Aldric: You have so much rage in you, Sir Connor...]
[S4_ETXT9   :Connor: If it has flourished, it is because you have nurtured it.]
[S4_ETXT10  :Aldric: Enough!  I am King, and you are my servant.]
[S4_ETXT11  :Aldric: I know you were fond of the Aluthans, and so it is that you might wish to know that they have begun a war with me, with us, if you still consider yourself a Seleran.]
[S4_ETXT12  :Aldric: Our people are few in number, and the northerners can feel that, can smell our weakness.  Oh how they hate us.]
[S4_ETXT13  :Connor: If they hate, it is because you taught them to hate, just as you taught me.]
[S4_ETXT14  :Aldric: If you had ever but felt the weight of gold upon your brow, Sir Connor.]
[S4_ETXT15  :Aldric: I am wearied by this discussion.  You will return here at midnight, and we shall discuss this matter further.]
[S4_ETXT16  :Connor: There is nothing more to discuss, my liege.]
[S4_ETXT17  :Aldric: Is there not?  Golem!]
[S4_ETXT18  :Aldric: Behold.  We are few, but we have grown mighty.]
[S4_ETXT19  :Aldric: Here is an army that knows no fear, no mercy.]
[S4_ETXT20  :Aldric: Here is a scourge for the north, which can forever rid of us the Aluthans, if I but will it.]
[S4_ETXT21  :Aldric: Speak to the Creator, if you doubt me.  You will find him in the cavern beneath the tower.]
[S4_ETXT22  :Aldric: Look upon them, think upon them, and return to me at midnight.]
[S4_ETXT23  :Connor: ...]

[S5_ETXTA   :Scene 5 & 6 completed.]
[S5_ETXT1   :Connor: Who are you?]
[S5_ETXT2   :Man: I am the Creator.  I am... a tinkerer, a toy-maker; nothing more.]
[S5_ETXT3   :Connor: You give life to these things...]
[S5_ETXT4   :Creator: Life?  What is life?  This is but a reflection of life reflected in but a muddy pool.]
[S5_ETXT5   :Creator: It is not life.  No, not life at all!]
[S5_ETXT6   :Creator: These are just toys.  But what fun toys are to play with, do you not agree, Sir Connor?]
[S5_ETXT7   :Connor: How do you know my name?]
[S5_ETXT8   :Creator: You are a great man, Sir Connor.  King Aldric speaks of you often.]
[S5_ETXT9   :Creator: Yes, often.  Like a parrot, "Sir Connor," he caws.]
[S5_ETXT10  :Creator: Yet, you do not know my name!  No, no name for me; I am the Creator, nameless, a toy-maker!]
[S5_ETXT11  :Connor: Yes...  I suppose you are.]
[S5_ETXT12  :Creator: Come, play with them!  Yet, be careful with Alpha 4, he's a bit... mad.  Kee kee kee...]
[S5_ETXT13  :Golem: I live to serve.]
[S5_ETXT14  :Golem: Beep!  Zoink!]
[S5_ETXT15  :Golem: Whee!]
[S5_ETXT16  :Golem: General protection fault!]
[S5_ETXT17  :Golem: ...]
[S5_ETXT18  :Kee kee kee...]

[S6_ETXT1   :Connor: Your "toy" nearly killed me!]
[S6_ETXT2   :Creator: A toy kill a knight!  Oh, dear, no!  Had I worried, kee kee, I would have stopped it.]
[S6_ETXT3   :Creator: But you are a great man!  "Connor," he caws.  Kee kee!]
[S6_ETXT4   :Creator: Alpha 4 needs to learn to protect, not attack, kee kee kee.]
[S6_ETXT5   :Connor: Be more careful in the future.]
[S6_ETXT6   :Creator: Oh, I am, kee kee kee!  I am already more careful.]

[S7_ETXT1   :Connor: Perhaps I should talk to the Creator before resting.]

[S8_ETXT1   :Woman: Richard...]

[S9_ETXT1   :Guard: King Aldric awaits you in the south-east tower.]

[S10_ETXT1  :Connor: I am here.]
[S10_ETXT2  :Aldric: Look out with me, Connor.]
[S10_ETXT3  :Aldric: As far as the eye can see are the lands that look to me for protection.]
[S10_ETXT4  :Connor: And beyond are those whose look southward in fear.]
[S10_ETXT5  :Aldric: In fear no longer, Sir Connor.]
[S10_ETXT6  :Connor: Sir, again, King Aldric?]
[S10_ETXT7  :Aldric: You were a good knight, Sir Connor.]
[S10_ETXT8  :Connor: I never wanted to be.]
[S10_ETXT9  :Aldric: We have little choice in this world.  Forces move us, and we must bend before them or snap.]
[S10_ETXT10 :Connor: There can be more honor in snapping.]
[S10_ETXT11 :Aldric: You sound like a knight, Sir Connor.]
[S10_ETXT12 :Connor: You sound like a man who has forsaken what he believes in.]
[S10_ETXT13 :Aldric: I have.  I am an old man, Connor, older than you know.]
[S10_ETXT14 :Aldric: Our people are long-lived, and the Soul Gem has preserved me.]
[S10_ETXT15 :Aldric: There are none to follow me, my sons are plague-dead and my wife, with no Soul Gem to prolong her life, is beyond as well.]
[S10_ETXT16 :Aldric: I am an old man and weary of hating.  There is a war coming, Connor, a terrible war.]
[S10_ETXT17 :Connor: A war of your causing!]
[S10_ETXT18 :Aldric: Enough, Connor, enough.  Let me speak.  I let you speak six years ago.]
[S10_ETXT19 :Connor: And then stripped me of my rank.]
[S10_ETXT20 :Aldric: Enough!  I do not wish to fight with you!]
[S10_ETXT21 :Aldric: There is a war between men, but that is nothing new.  We have fought for ages, we weak children of God.]
[S10_ETXT22 :Aldric: But yet that is not all.  I am tied to the Earth, and I can hear its whispering.]
[S10_ETXT23 :Aldric: There is a darkness stirring, a terrible darkness.]
[S10_ETXT24 :Aldric: I fear when it comes, we will need the Aluthans beside us, not against us.]
[S10_ETXT25 :Connor: The Unnamed?]
[S10_ETXT26 :Aldric: Perhaps.  I do not know.  I am no Selera, to face him if he comes again.  Not alone.]
[S10_ETXT27 :Aldric: So I need you to go north, Connor, one last time for me.]
[S10_ETXT28 :Aldric: The Aluthans have destroyed the town of Holbrooke.  I cannot allow them to come further: I am guardian of Selera.]
[S10_ETXT29 :Aldric: Go north and speak to the people who were once your friends; convince them to turn away from the path of war.  Tell them what you must, promise what you must.]
[S10_ETXT30 :Connor: And if they refuse?]
[S10_ETXT31 :Aldric: Then may God have mercy on them, for I shall not.]
[S10_ETXT32 :Aldric: Good luck, Sir Connor.  I trust you will leave for North Pass tomorrow.  Learn what happened at Holbrooke, and make peace for me.]
[S10_ETXT33 :Connor: For you, Anna.  One last time home, for you.]

[S11_ETXT1  :Connor: To go north again, after so long...]

[S12_ETXT1  :Merchant: You are silly if you want to go through North Pass.  Horrible monsters guard it!  I barely made it through.  I wish I could say the same for my guards.]
[S12_ETXT2  :Merchant: You want to buy my contract with Ryan?  He is worth quite a bit to me.  Bring me 200 Aurum and the contract is yours.]
[S12_ETXT3  :Merchant: Wow, you have 200 Aurum already?  I'll take that.  Okay, he's all yours.]
[S12_ETXT4  :Merchant: Jolly good doing business with you!]

[S13_ETXT1  :Connor: I need a guide to take me through North Pass.]
[S13_ETXT2  :Guide: Well, you're out of luck, buddy.  Sure, I'm the famous guide Ryan, but I'm already under contract with old moneybags over there.]
[S13_ETXT3  :Connor: This is a mission of utmost importance.]
[S13_ETXT4  :Ryan: Blah, blah, blah?  What did you say?  I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear...  I was thinking about how I need to eat, and how I need money to eat.  So could you repeat yourself?]
[S13_ETXT5  :Connor: I'm sure the King will reward you handsomely!]
[S13_ETXT6  :Ryan: Blah, blah?  Could you repeat that?]
[S13_ETXT7  :Connor: To hell with you!  I can't believe anyone would be so selfish!]
[S13_ETXT8  :Ryan: Selfish, is it?  Now...  Let me get this right, because I'm so easily confused.]
[S13_ETXT9  :Ryan: You want me to abandon a man I'm sworn to protect, give up my payment, after having fought my way through a horde of monsters, all just to help you out?]
[S13_ETXT10 :Ryan: And you're offering me nothing to do this?  So... umm... who was selfish?]
[S13_ETXT11 :Connor: If I were doing this for myself, it would be different.  This is for Selera.]
[S13_ETXT12 :Ryan: Fancy that!  I'm not a Seleran!  I'm from Fairport.]
[S13_ETXT13 :Connor: Please!]
[S13_ETXT14 :Ryan: Look, I'd love to help you.  You'd love to buy my contract from my boss.  It's that simple.]
[S13_ETXT15 :Connor: Fine.]
[S13_ETXT16 :Connor: I bought your contract.]
[S13_ETXT17 :Ryan: Well then, boss, it's a pleasure to help out.  You want to go back through North Pass?]
[S13_ETXT18 :Connor: Yes.]
[S13_ETXT19 :Ryan: Heh.  I'll make it through alive.  I can't make any promises about you.  You seem a bit slow, ya know?]
[S13_ETXT20 :Ryan: The pass is filled with monsters, and there's a big one in there, a wolf-man.]
[S13_ETXT21 :Ryan: He ripped up three guards moneybags had with him.  Luckily, I got him one in the eye and we got away.]
[S13_ETXT22 :Connor: I can handle myself.]
[S13_ETXT23 :Ryan: Sure you can.  That's why you just pleaded with me, and bribed me to help you out.  But hey, you're right!  You're a tough guy.]
[S13_ETXT24 :Connor: Let's just go.]

[S14_ETXT1  :Ryan: That's where we holed up.  Real smart, huh?]
[S14_ETXT2  :Ryan: It came in at night once we ran out of firewood, and killed the others.]
[S14_ETXT3  :Ryan: Might be stuff worth taking in there.]
[S14_ETXT4  :Connor: Robbing the dead?]
[S14_ETXT5  :Ryan: I like to think of it as repossession.]
[S14_ETXT6  :Connor: You have no morals!]
[S14_ETXT7  :Ryan: Morals?  My moral is this: live and let live.  And if not, put an arrow in their heart and say good night.  Once you're dead, who cares about morals?  Those guards don't need their gold.]
[S14_ETXT8  :Connor: Morals are what make us human!]
[S14_ETXT9  :Ryan: Thinking for yourself is what makes you human.  But we aren't a debate club, we're adventurers, aren't we?  So why don't we go adventure some.]
[S14_ETXT10 :Connor: Hrm.]
[S14_ETXT11 :What a strange rock.]
[S14_STXT1  :North Pass:|Beware of wolves!]

[S15_ETXT1  :Werewolf: Humans!  I... hate... you!!]
[S15_ETXT2  :Ryan: It's a cyclops!  Oh, wait, no, it's just a wolf-man who's come back to lose his other eye.]
[S15_ETXT3  :Ryan: Well, my job's done.  So...  I'll just leave here, and I'll go claim that big reward with your king.]
[S15_ETXT4  :Connor: Good riddance.]

[S16_ETXT1  :Merchant: Welcome to my town, effendi!]
[S16_ETXT2  :Connor: YOUR town?]
[S16_ETXT3  :Merchant: Of course, my friend.  They do not call it "Hassan's Oasis" for nothing.]
[S16_ETXT4  :Connor: This is Kassim Oasis.]
[S16_ETXT5  :Hassan: Kassim, Hassan, they are very similar in sound.  The Seleran Translators are renowned for their butchering of our language.]
[S16_ETXT6  :Connor: I see.]
[S16_ETXT7  :Hassan: So what brings you to this opal of the sands, this breeze in the summer?]
[S16_ETXT8  :Connor: I am traveling north to Alutha.]
[S16_ETXT9  :Hassan: To Alutha!  May God watch over you!  The Aluthans are bestial people.]
[S16_ETXT10 :Connor: Are they, now?]
[S16_ETXT11 :Hassan: Indeed, my friend!  Why, I have heard, from none but the most reliable of the trustworthy, that their men don't know their fathers and the women are hairier than bears!]
[S16_ETXT12 :Connor: My... wife... was an Aluthan.]
[S16_ETXT13 :Hassan: Effendi!  Hassan does not know how to swim!]
[S16_ETXT14 :Connor: Then you may lie with the fishes.]
[S16_ETXT15 :Hassan: EFFENDI!  Please!  Excuse this old fool!]
[S16_ETXT16 :Hassan: I must have been tricked by the most deceitful of the liars!  Oh, forgive me!]
[S16_ETXT17 :Hassan: Please, I will make it worth your kindness if you but spare me!]
[S16_ETXT18 :Connor: And how is that?]
[S16_ETXT19 :Hassan: A five percent discount, on all my wares!]
[S16_ETXT20 :Connor: Five percent?]
[S16_ETXT21 :Hassan: Ayeee!  Ten percent, my friend, but no higher, or you would better just kill me now, for drowning is more noble a fate than starving.  But I will also give you this Gem, more precious than water or gold!  The traveler who sold it said there were but nine in the whole world, and that each has its own magical nature.  For free, effendi!]
[S16_ETXT22 :Connor: This stone?  It doesn't even look real.]
[S16_ETXT23 :Hassan: It is no simple ruby, effendi, but a mystical talisman.  Its might is now expired, but should you fill it with the essence of your foes, it shall grow in power.]
[S16_ETXT24 :Connor: Fine.  I'll let you live, Hassan.  But be careful what you say.]
[S16_ETXT25 :Hassan: You are the most benevolent of the kind, the most beatific of the saints, my lord!  Now I will be hurrying to my store.  Stop by if you have any needs.]

[S17_ETXT1  :Strange Man: I am the Wadji Gutana.  I have become one with the flames.]
[S17_ETXT2  :Connor: Step aside.  I need to pass through.]
[S17_ETXT3  :Gutana: The flames make my blood boil and my dreams sear my mind.  I feel ecstasy.]
[S17_ETXT4  :Connor: I'll ask you one more time, step aside.]
[S17_ETXT5  :Gutana: You will burn for a thousand years!  Your flesh shall scorch and your fat sizzle, your hairs shall curl and your eyes turn to fluid.  And above it all I shall dance with the flame, twisting, caressing the fire.]
[S17_ETXT6  :Voice: Heretic!!]
[S17_ETXT7  :Wizard: Gutana, once apprentice of the Magi, I have come to bring you back to the Tower.]
[S17_ETXT8  :Gutana: I have become one with the flames!]
[S17_ETXT9  :Wizard: Then, with your flames shall you be extinguished!]

[S18_ETXT1  :Wizard: I am Elya, First Apprentice of the Tower of Magi.]
[S18_ETXT2  :Connor: I'm Sir Connor of Selera.  I've been sent to investigate Holbrooke and to make peace with the Aluthans.]
[S18_ETXT3  :Elya: Holbrooke is it?  I have business there myself.]
[S18_ETXT4  :Connor: And what would that be?]
[S18_ETXT5  :Elya: There was a great surge of magical energy in that area, strong enough that its ripples were felt in the Tower.]
[S18_ETXT6  :Elya: The stench of the spell permeates this entire region.]
[S18_ETXT7  :Elya: As the only Apprentice in the Tower, I was sent to determine the source of this energy, and deal with it as necessary.]
[S18_ETXT8  :Connor: Well then, I could use a wizard at my side.]
[S18_ETXT9  :Elya: And I a knight.  Yet be wary.  In this world of ours, even a sword and a spell may not be sufficient to guard us.]
[S18_ETXT10 :Connor: I have passed the point where death meant much to me.  If it comes, let it come, I am ready.]
[S18_ETXT11 :Elya: I am not ready to die, Sir Connor, and as long as we are companions, I expect you will respect my wishes.]
[S18_ETXT12 :Connor: You're safe with me, wizard.]
[S18_ETXT13 :Elya: Very well then.]

[S19_ETXT1  :Connor: It's totally empty.]
[S19_ETXT2  :Elya: Something is wrong here.  I feel it.  There is fell magic at work.]
[S19_ETXT3  :Connor: The world is an evil place.  That's why we're here, isn't it?]
[S19_ETXT4  :Elya: Keep your sword ready, knight, and your tongue still.]

[S20_ETXT1  :Connor: What were those things?  I saw one in North Pass earlier...]
[S20_ETXT2  :Elya: They are less than human...and more.  There is a great corruption welling up in the world, and this is but one effect.]
[S20_ETXT3  :Elya: I sensed horrible pain in them, great anger.  They know what they have lost, but do not know how to regain it, so they hate us for our humanity.]
[S20_ETXT4  :Connor: Less than human...were they men once?]
[S20_ETXT5  :Elya: Perhaps.  Let us investigate further, there must be a clue somewhere.]

[S21_ETXT1  :Victor: The... song...]
[S21_ETXT2  :Victor: Huumans...I hate you...]
[S21_ETXT3  :Elya: Watch out!]
[S21_ETXT4  :Victor: So... much... pain.  I... help me.]
[S21_ETXT5  :Connor: You can speak?]
[S21_ETXT6  :Victor: I... am... who... am...I?]
[S21_ETXT7  :Connor: You are Victor, a Pathfinder of Turren.]
[S21_ETXT8  :Victor: Vic... tor... yes!  I am a human!]
[S21_ETXT9  :Elya: Not any more, Victor.  You're a monster now.]
[S21_ETXT10 :Victor: No!  I'm a human!  Not... an... animal!  I am a human!]
[S21_ETXT11 :Elya: Kill him, Connor.  He'll turn.]
[S21_ETXT12 :Connor: No, I won't kill him.  We need you to lead us to Holbrooke, Victor.]
[S21_ETXT13 :Victor: Yes... I will lead you.  Come, let's go!  The little wizard can come too.]
[S21_ETXT14 :Elya: I'll be watching you, Victor.]
[S21_ETXT15 :Victor: Watch all you want.  But just remember... I bite back.]

[S22_ETXT1  :Connor: Snap out of it, Victor!]
[S22_ETXT2  :Elya: He can't hear you.  He's no longer human.]
[S22_ETXT3  :Victor: Hu... man...]
[S22_ETXT4  :Tree: Human, wolf, man or beast, there is no difference.  All things are but vessels for the darkness.  Your world has come to its end.  Fight on, fight on, but for nothing.  You will become slaves or you will become corpses, until all the world is awash in suffering.]
[S22_ETXT5  :Elya: I defy you, demon.  The Magi stand firm against the darkness.  Our light is a bastion against the darkness, our will a force against the shadow.]
[S22_ETXT6  :Tree: The will of men!  Come, then, test your will now!]
[S22_ETXT7  :Victor: I..|am...|Victor!]
[S22_ETXT8  :Connor: These roots!]

[S23_ETXT1  :Victor: Wha... it's like... a horrible nightmare has passed.]
[S23_ETXT2  :Connor: The demon is dead.]
[S23_ETXT3  :Victor: But... I'm still a monster!  Why?  Wizard, why?  Why aren't I healed?]
[S23_ETXT4  :Elya: It's not so simple, Victor.  Lycanthropy is a powerful spell, and it is perpetual.]
[S23_ETXT5  :Elya: It doesn't stop when the caster dies.  It can only be reversed by an even more difficult counter-spell.]
[S23_ETXT6  :Victor: Then cast the spell!]
[S23_ETXT7  :Elya: I'm an apprentice, I don't have the power.]
[S23_ETXT8  :Victor: Who does?  How can I be healed?  Tell me!]
[S23_ETXT9  :Elya: Come with me to the Tower of Magi, and perhaps the Archmage can restore you.]
[S23_ETXT10 :Victor: To the Tower of Magic?  So be it!  I would go to Hell if that's what it took.  Life isn't worth living as a beast.]
[S23_ETXT11 :Connor: Elya... what was that thing?  In the past few days I've seen horrors that make the war between Selera and Alutha pale in comparison.  These creatures... this demon... what is happening?]
[S23_ETXT12 :Elya: The Earth is remembering evil.]
[S23_ETXT13 :Connor: Remembering evil?  There's been evil enough in my lifetime!  Wars, murder, betrayal, destruction...]
[S23_ETXT14 :Elya: There has been anger, fear, disease... these are natural.  Not evil.  Evil is not hatred, it is not terror, and it is not an illness.  It transcends these things.  Evil has but one wellspring, and it is in a deep and terrible place.]
[S23_ETXT15 :Victor: And where is that, wizard?]
[S23_ETXT16 :Elya: I need to know more first.  We must go to Holbrooke.]
[S23_ETXT17 :Connor: To Holbrooke then, where answers may be found.]
[S23_ETXT18 :Elya: Some answers are best left unknown, Sir Connor.  You will learn more than you wish, I fear.]
[S23_ETXT19 :Victor: Whatever it takes!]

[S24_ETXT1  :Connor: My God...]
[S24_ETXT2  :Victor: This smell is horrible...]
[S24_ETXT3  :Elya: The smell is worse when you can perceive changes in the ether.  A horrible thing has been done here.]
[S24_ETXT4  :Victor: Obvious enough, wizard.]
[S24_ETXT5  :Elya: No, not the killing.  That is horrible in its own way.  But not the killing.]
[S24_ETXT6  :Elya: These people were killed by magic.]
[S24_ETXT7  :Victor: You killed monsters with magic, beasts who were once men.]
[S24_ETXT8  :Elya: Different, again.]
[S24_ETXT9  :Elya: Terribly different.  This is not magic of our variety.  It... is a darker sort.  Perhaps an older sort, practiced when our race believed in many bloodthirsty gods.  This is death magic here, human sacrifice.]
[S24_ETXT10 :Victor: Explain yourself.]
[S24_ETXT11 :Elya: Not now, not here.  I need more answers.]
[S24_ETXT12 :Connor: Are you sure you want them?]
[S24_ETXT13 :Elya: No, no I'm not.  But the other Magi will.  It came from the north.  From the Aluthans.]
[S24_ETXT14 :Connor: Well then, our paths remain together.]
[S24_ETXT15 :Victor: And I stay with you, wizard.]
[S24_ETXT16 :Elya: Like a dog on a leash.]
[S24_ETXT17 :Connor: Stop it!  There's been enough killing here.  More than enough.  Let's go.]

[S25_ETXT1  :Guards: Selerans!]
[S25_ETXT2  :Voice: Hold.]
[S25_ETXT3  :Voice: I'll handle this, men.]
[S25_ETXT4  :Connor: Roland.]
[S25_ETXT5  :Roland: What are you doing here, Connor?]
[S25_ETXT6  :Connor: Are we not brothers, Roland?  Don't you remember our pledge?]
[S25_ETXT7  :Roland: Pledge?  What are words, compared to blood?  You will die here today.]
[S25_ETXT8  :Connor: Die?  Roland, what are you doing?  I'm here on a mission of peace.]
[S25_ETXT9  :Roland: You came here eight years ago on a mission of peace... or have you forgotten?  Your honeyed tongue conviced us all, my father, my love... oh God, Anna.  Have you forgotten so quickly, you Seleran dog?]
[S25_ETXT10 :Roland: You came here, you smiled and whispered... you praised and embraced me.  We studied the sword side by side.  And then you took Anna, took her to die of a plague on foreign soil.]
[S25_ETXT11 :Roland: To be buried in the filth of Selera.  Took her to never see her home again, never see her family, to never laugh again, to never run through the meadows again.  Have you forgotten?]
[S25_ETXT12 :Connor: I will never forget Anna, Roland.  You have forgotten her if you think she would want this.  Do you believe she would have smiled as you razed Holbrooke?  Do you think she would laugh as you threatened me?  She loved me, Roland, and I her!]
[S25_ETXT13 :Roland: Did you love her when Selera brought the sword to Alutha?  Did you love her when our women were dishonored?  Each one of those women loved someone, a father, a brother, a husband.]
[S25_ETXT14 :Roland: Did you love her when they beat me?  I loved her then.  I held her memory close, like a thorn in my heart.  I remember her face, and then I think of what you did to her, how you killed her.]
[S25_ETXT15 :Connor: We were brothers once, we are brothers still.]
[S25_ETXT16 :Roland: You lost the right to call me brother when you took her away.  Now draw your sword and face me as a man, or turn tail like a dog.  It matters little to me.  Either way, your pride dies here.]
[S25_ETXT17 :Connor: You still think this is about PRIDE, Roland, that this is about HONOR?  It stopped being a matter of honor after what my people did to yours, after what you did to Holbrooke.  This is about LIFE and DEATH, Roland, nothing else.]
[S25_ETXT18 :Roland: Then die, Seleran.]
[S25_ETXT19 :Roland: Pathetic.  I hardly... broke... a sweat.]
[S25_ETXT20 :Connor: Kill me.  I'm ready to join Anna.]
[S25_ETXT21 :Roland: No.  No, you have a message to bring to your King.  Get up.]
[S25_ETXT22 :Roland: Follow me.]
[S25_ETXT23 :Roland: Beautiful, isn't it?]
[S25_ETXT24 :Connor: What is this?]
[S25_ETXT25 :Roland: Death for death, Connor.  Death for death.  The Geist Cannon takes life twice.  Watch, watch closely, for Aldric will wish to hear of this.]
[S25_ETXT26 :Roland: Bring the Seleran!]
[S25_ETXT27 :Roland: Fire!]
[S25_ETXT28 :Roland: You have seen it now, my answer to your King.  You may have come in peace, but leave now for war.  There will be no peace, only vengeance.  Tell Aldric that he may hide, that he may flee, but we will follow his people to the ends of the Earth.  Tell him of the suffering that will come.]

[S26_ETXT1  :Connor: ... "death for death," he said.]
[S26_ETXT2  :Aldric: So it comes to this.  The darkness I felt is within us, not the Earth.  This evil is man made.  Three hundred years ago, Alutha killed Selera, and now his descendants have come to finish the evil he began.]
[S26_ETXT3  :Connor: They have come not to fulfill that sin, but rather because of the sins we have committed against their people for the last three centuries.]]
[S26_ETXT4  :Connor: It is your persecution of them, for that old legend, that has brought this war!]
[S26_ETXT5  :Guard: Your majesty, we are under attack!]
[S26_ETXT6  :Aldric: The Geist Cannon?  Already?  Send the Golem!  All of them!]
[S26_ETXT7  :Guard: It is the Golem who have attacked, your majesty!]
[S26_ETXT8  :Aldric: What?!]
[S26_ETXT9  :Guard: We are betrayed...]
[S26_ETXT10  :Victor: I smell... decay.]
[S26_ETXT11 :Aldric: Disaster upon disaster.  You must take the Soul Gem from my room and flee.]
[S26_ETXT12 :Connor: My duty is here.  I am a Knight of Selera.]
[S26_ETXT13 :Aldric: And so your duty is to me!  I order you to take the Soul Gem and flee!]
[S26_ETXT14 :Connor: Not now... I am not a coward.]
[S26_ETXT15 :Aldric: In the name of God, Connor, GO!  There is a secret passage behind the bookshelf in my room.  Hurry!]
[S26_ETXT16 :Creator: The little King on his mighty throne!  See how it trembles!]
[S26_ETXT17 :Creator: The Soul Gem shall be mine, kee kee kee.]
[S26_ETXT18 :Aldric: You'll find I'm harder to kill than a mere guard.]
[S26_ETXT19 :Creator: Oh!  Kee kee!  Are you?  Not to me!  No, no!]

[S27_ETXT1  :Elya: I had heard of the Soul Gem... but I never thought I'd see it.  It is magnificant.]
[S27_ETXT2  :Victor: It's a rock.]
[S27_ETXT3  :Elya: To you, a rock.  But when you can feel its energy, comprehend its essence...]
[S27_ETXT4  :Victor: It's still a rock.  Take it and let's go.]

[S28_ETXT1  :Connor: I knew the Creator and his Golem were evil.]
[S28_ETXT2  :Elya: Creator?  Golem?  Your King used that word, "golem."  What was he referring to?]
[S28_ETXT3  :Connor: Statues, given life.]
[S28_ETXT4  :Elya: What?]
[S28_ETXT5  :Elya: Your King allowed WHAT?]
[S28_ETXT6  :Connor: The Creator came to Selera and constructed beings called Golem... an entire army of them.]
[S28_ETXT7  :Elya: You fools!  That violates the most basic tenet of the Magi: life shall never be created.]
[S28_ETXT8  :Connor: And why is that?]
[S28_ETXT9  :Elya: FOOL!  Life must come from life!  For an army to be made, an army must be slain.  How could your King sanction such slaughter?]
[S28_ETXT10 :Connor: Slaughter?]
[S28_ETXT11 :Elya: For each new life, there must be a life taken.  How many hundreds did your King kill?]
[S28_ETXT12 :Connor: Kill... oh God... the plague...]
[S28_ETXT13 :Elya: This "Creator" whom your King has aided is none other than Kraith, a mage exiled from our Tower for his studies in the creation of life.]
[S28_ETXT14 :Elya: In fact, I was sent to investigate the matter in Holbrooke, because the energy there bore patterns remarkably similar to his.  Now I see this evil runs deeper.]
[S28_ETXT15 :Elya: How many have been sacrificed on the altar of this war of yours?  How many more will die?]
[S28_ETXT16 :Connor: Life... for life?  Are the spirits...]
[S28_ETXT17 :Elya: Trapped inside the "Golem."  Forever.  Yet there is likely little left of them, under his spells, and beneath the suffering he has put upon them.]
[S28_ETXT18 :Elya: Hundreds of souls twisted into weapons.  Your King is no better than the wielders of the Geist Cannon.]
[S28_ETXT19 :Victor: Wizard, we are trapped in a sewer.  You may have a sense for magic, but I have one for smell.  I don't want to sit around in this filth.  Finish your whining when we get out of here, or there will be three more lost souls for this Creator.]
[S28_ETXT20 :Connor: He's right.  But... Anna... Anna...]
[S28_ETXT21 :Victor: Pull yourselves together!]

[S29_ETXT1  :Connor: Golem back the way we came, and we're stuck between mountains and the sea...]
[S29_ETXT2  :Ryan: Well, boss, looks like I showed up just in time.  Seems that your oh-so-important quest didn't come together too well?]
[S29_ETXT3  :Connor: Ryan!?]
[S29_ETXT4  :Ryan: None other!  Your King stiffed me on the reward, so I figure we can work out an agreement here.  I think all of your money sounds quite reasonable, don't you?]
[S29_ETXT5  :Victor: How about I don't rip your head off, and you give us a ride?]
[S29_ETXT6  :Ryan: Woof woof?  How about I step back on my boat and you get stuck kenneled in a town that is about to get destroyed?]
[S29_ETXT7  :Elya: You scoundrel.]
[S29_ETXT8  :Ryan: I'm about to save your lives.  I think that makes me something more than a scoundrel.]
[S29_ETXT9  :Ryan: But... just so that I don't prove you wrong and hurt your feelings...]
[S29_ETXT10 :Connor: Wait!  Take the money!]
[S29_ETXT11 :Ryan: Now that's more like it!  All aboard!]

[S30_ETXT1  :Ryan: All right, here's your stop.]
[S30_ETXT2  :Connor: Where are we?]
[S30_ETXT3  :Ryan: Away from Selera.  You'll find my old stomping grounds to the northeast of here, might be able to find a bite to eat at the Inn there.  I'm sure you'll scrape some change together.]
[S30_ETXT3B :Ryan: Near Turren.  You'll find that wolf-infested town to the south.]
[S30_ETXT4  :Ryan: Later!]
[S30_ETXT5  :Victor: So now what?]
[S30_ETXT6  :Elya: We need to get to the Tower of Magi.  They must know what has happened.]
[S30_ETXT7  :Victor: You don't need to tell me that!  Every time I see my claws, my fur, I know we need to get there!  But what are you going to do?  Summon us a boat?]
[S30_ETXT8  :Connor: Ryan told me he was from Fairport.  That must be his "old stomping grounds."  We can go there and hire a boat to take us to the Tower.]

[S31_ETXT1  :Green Mask: That's far enough, throw down your weapons and leave.]
[S31_ETXT2  :Connor: You need to return the ships to Fairport.]
[S31_ETXT3  :Green Mask: You need to realize when to back down, tough guy.]
[S31_ETXT4  :Victor: To hell with this talking!]

[S32_ETXT1  :Green Mask: Calm down guys!]
[S32_ETXT2  :Green Mask: I wasn't actually gonna attack you or anything.]
[S32_ETXT3  :Connor: Ryan?!]
[S32_ETXT4  :Victor: You... son of a...]
[S32_ETXT5  :Ryan: Hey... who's the dog here?  I wouldn't go insulting my lineage if I were you!]
[S32_ETXT6  :Elya: It little matters whether you are Ryan, or Green Mask, or any other name.  You will give us the ships now, or we'll dispose of you and your little band of thieves.]
[S32_ETXT7  :Ryan: Ooh, now even the little girl wants to talk the talk.  If not for dog-face there, we woulda sent you to kingdom come...]
[S32_ETXT8  :Connor: Enough, Ryan.  We need your ship.  Return the others, and take us to the Tower of Magi.  Time is of the essence.]
[S32_ETXT9  :Ryan: Yeah, fine, you win!  Happy?]

[S33_ETXT1  :Ryan: So now what?]
[S33_ETXT2  :Elya: We're here now, we have the Soul Gem, all will be well.  You will be cured, and the Magi will be stirred to deal with this terrible calamity.  The tower is to the east.  We'll need to pass through the Cave of Shadows to get there.]
[S33_ETXT3  :Ryan: Why didn't you guys think to build your tower in a place that DIDN'T require an absurd amount of work to get to?]
[S33_ETXT4  :Elya: Because then people like you might stop by.]
[S33_ETXT5  :Ryan: Most people can settle for a "Do Not Disturb" sign, not some Cave of Shadows.]
[S33_ETXT6  :Victor: Enough!  Let's go!]

[S34_ETXT1  :Elya: Master, I have returned.]
[S34_ETXT2  :ArchMage: Yes, that is obvious.  I presume this means you have failed?]
[S34_ETXT3  :Elya: No.  I have succeeded.  And perhaps, that is more terrible now than failure.  Kraith lives, and has destroyed Selera.]
[S34_ETXT4  :Elya: Moreover, the Aluthans have acquired a weapon of unthinkable power, called the "Geist Cannon."  Utilizing a form of necromancy, it can kill one man and use his life force to destroy a massive area.]
[S34_ETXT5  :ArchMage: This sounds... unlikely to me.  No such weapon could be created.  Not without the aid of a great Master Wizard.]
[S34_ETXT6  :Elya: Please, master, believe me.]
[S34_ETXT7  :ArchMage: I believe that you THOUGHT you saw such things, Elya.  But there is a reason why never have we had a female Mage.  Your senses are easily disturbed.  I understand how emotional trauma could lead you to feel such things... such is your weakness.]
[S34_ETXT8  :Elya: Master, I know what I saw.]
[S34_ETXT9  :Connor: She's telling you the truth!]
[S34_ETXT10 :ArchMage: Ah, a layman seeks to tell me about magic.  Perhaps next I could instruct you in swordplay?]
[S34_ETXT11 :Ryan: You know what?  I didn't see this Geist Cannon, but I did see some big men made out of rock attacking Selera.  And you've got a man with a dog's face right in front of you.  Don't stick your head in the sand.]
[S34_ETXT12 :ArchMage: There is evil abroad, and within.  Yet it is only when disaster is near that we must be cautious.  The man who is cautious when times are safe is a coward.  He who is trusting when the times are perilous is a fool.  I am neither.  I will send a Mage to investigate this matter, and he shall determine whether what you say is true.]
[S34_ETXT13 :Elya: If you doubt me... look at this!]
[S34_ETXT14 :ArchMage: The Soul Gem?!]
[S34_ETXT15 :Elya: Kraith sought it in Selera.]
[S34_ETXT16 :ArchMage: You saw his face?]
[S34_ETXT17 :Elya: No.]
[S34_ETXT18 :ArchMage: Then I shall send a Mage to determine the truth.]
[S34_ETXT19 :Elya: NO!  Why don't you believe me?]
[S34_ETXT20 :ArchMage: You are an apprentice.]
[S34_ETXT21 :Elya: Then let me... let me take the Trials now!]
[S34_ETXT22 :ArchMage: No apprentice has survived the Trials in ten years, Elya.  And they were stronger than you!  You are too ambitious.  Bide your time.  Your kind is not well suited to magic.]
[S34_ETXT23 :Elya: NO!  I will die if need be, and prove the truth with my blood!  But you cannot wait, not now.  Let me prove myself!]
[S34_ETXT24 :ArchMage: Very well then.  You know where to begin.]
[S34_ETXT25 :Connor: What's going on, Elya?]
[S34_ETXT26 :Elya: I am going to become a Mage now, no longer an apprentice.]
[S34_ETXT27 :Ryan: Riiiight.  Well, best of luck to ya.]
[S34_ETXT28 :Victor: What about me?  I need to be cured of this curse!]
[S34_ETXT29 :ArchMage: If Elya succeeds, she and I will perform the incantation.]
[S34_ETXT30 :Elya: Enough!  I must go now!]


[S35_ETXT1  :Elya: Who... what... are you?]
[S35_ETXT2  :Woman: Come into my embrace... I can show you pleasures that transcend all mortal passions.]
[S35_ETXT3  :Elya: Never!  You... you're part of the Trials!]
[S35_ETXT4  :Exanima: No, I am not.  I am Exanima, the eater of souls.  I have been fatted on the children that have been sent my way.  It has been long since they have fed me...  I appreciate your coming.  I have not yet dined on a female soul.]
[S35_ETXT5  :Elya: The other apprentices...]
[S35_ETXT6  :Exanima: One by one, they found their way to me.  And one by one, I ate them whole, both body and soul.  It was quite a feast, course after course of dishes... truly a magical experience.]
[S35_ETXT7  :Elya: You beast!]
[S35_ETXT8  :Exanima: Demon, really, but I'm not picky with names.  Now come, and experience oblivion.]

[S36_ETXT1  :Elya: It is done.]
[S36_ETXT2  :ArchMage: How... can... this be?]
[S36_ETXT3  :Elya: There was a demon at the end of the Trials, a creature called "Exanima."  It was killing the other apprentices when they went through.  Each time you sent a boy to become a master, he was killed, and the beast grew stronger.]
[S36_ETXT4  :ArchMage: So it was strongest...]
[S36_ETXT5  :Elya: When I faced it.  Do you doubt me still?]
[S36_ETXT6  :ArchMage: No... no, I cannot now.  You are truly a Mage.]
[S36_ETXT7  :Victor: Ahem...]
[S36_ETXT8  :ArchMage: Ah yes.  Elya, come here.]
[S36_ETXT8B :* Victor regains human form!]
[S36_ETXT9  :Victor: At last!]
[S36_ETXT10 :Ryan: Aw... now who are we gonna feed our scraps to?]
[S36_ETXT11 :Connor: Stop!  All right.  What are we going to do?]
[S36_ETXT12 :Elya: We need to find Kraith.]
[S36_ETXT13 :Victor: No.  First, I need to go home.  My people need my help.]
[S36_ETXT14 :Connor: Fine, we'll take Victor home, then see what we can do to capture Kraith.  I have... something to tell him when next I see him.]
[S36_ETXT15 :Ryan: Then it's back to my ship... I guess that means back through your little cavern.]
[S36_ETXT16 :ArchMage: Not really.]
[S36_ETXT17 :Ryan: Hey, I could get used to that kinda service, if I didn't love the sea air so much!  Now let's go!]

[S37_ETXT1  :Victor: Why did anyone ever trust that scoundrel?]
[S37_ETXT2  :Elya: What shall come, shall come.  Kraith may yet be near Selera.  For now, let us return you to your home.]

[S38_ETXT1  :Mayor: They... all... turned... you're... too... late...]
[S38_ETXT2  :Victor: No!  We killed the demon!]
[S38_ETXT3  :Mayor: Too... late... all the people have turned... they are all gone.]
[S38_ETXT4  :Victor: NO!]
[S38_ETXT5  :Mayor: Now... even I am... too weak.]
[S38_ETXT6  :Victor: There's nothing left for me.  Nothing.]
[S38_ETXT7  :Connor: Revenge.  Revenge is always left.  Now Kraith owes us all a debt, and the interest will be steep.]
[S38_ETXT8  :Elya: Let's go.]

[S39_ETXT1_1:Roland: Connor!]
[S39_ETXT1_2:Roland: So... the wheel turns full circle, and now I am ground once more into the dirt.]
[S39_ETXT2  :Connor: What are you talking about?]
[S39_ETXT3  :Roland: You know too well.  These Seleran Golem are immune to the Geist Cannon.  They do not live, and unliving, cannot be affected.  What irony.]
[S39_ETXT4  :Connor: The Golem are not Seleran, Roland.  They belong to ...]
[S39_ETXT5  :Soldier: Prince Roland!]
[S39_ETXT6  :Connor: They are my enemies too!]
[S39_ETXT7  :Roland: Then we fight together once more... brother.]
[S39_ETXT8  :Roland: You...?  Are you here to save us once more?]
[S39_ETXT9  :Kraith: Save you?  Oh, princeling, kee kee!  You are such a fool, so blind, so blind.]
[S39_ETXT10 :Kraith: Look at the beautiful death that surrounds us.  Look at the wonderful slaughter you have created!]
[S39_ETXT11 :Kraith: Kee!  Now it is your turn to join the others.]
[S39_ETXT12 :Connor: You know him, Roland?]
[S39_ETXT13 :Kraith: Kee kee!  Knight and prince, and little wizard too!  All here, kee kee kee!]
[S39_ETXT14 :Connor: You... you... I...]
[S39_ETXT15 :Kraith: The little knight is tongue tied?  Am I evil?  Oh ho ho ho ho!  No no!  Not evil, kee kee!  Just me!  And now...]
[S39_ETXT16 :Creator: I'll see you in Alutha!  Kee kee kee!]

[S40_STXT1  :Connor: We can't go back.  We must go to Alutha.]

[S40_ETXT1  :Roland: God curse his soul!  Betrayal upon betrayal!]
[S40_ETXT2  :Connor: So now you see what your hatred has brought you to, Roland.  Now we all suffer the consequences of your wrath.]
[S40_ETXT3  :Roland: I haven't forgotten my vengeance yet, Connor, not yet.]
[S40_ETXT4  :Elya: This is not the time.  We must stand united now.  This is humanity against demons, and smaller feuds are drowned out in the greater strife.]
[S40_ETXT5  :Victor: Enough talk!  Let's regroup, and attack!]
[S40_ETXT6  :Elya: Attack?  No, Victor.  Your blood has not yet cooled, despite my spell.  Use your mind.  We are ruled by reason, not emotion, we are humans, not beasts.  We cannot defeat Kraith, not now.  We must warn Alutha of the impending attack.]
[S40_ETXT7  :Roland: For what?  For what!  The Geist Cannon will make short work of any defense we can hope to muster!]
[S40_ETXT8  :Elya: Perhaps, perhaps.  Yet better they be warned.]
[S40_ETXT9  :Connor: She's right.  Let's move.]

[S41_ETXT1  :Victor: Wait...]
[S41_ETXT2  :Victor: Kraith has been through here already.]
[S41_ETXT3  :Connor: How?]
[S41_ETXT4  :Elya: Maybe a shortcut over the mountain?]
[S41_ETXT5  :Roland: They've cut past us then.  We need to hurry!  Alutha is just north of Durgardt.]

[S42_ETXT1  :Roland: No... we're too late.  They've used the Geist Cannon.]
[S42_ETXT2  :Elya: No, I don't sense the energy I felt before.  And look, these men were killed by physical means, not magic.  Yet we must hurry nonetheless.]

[S43_ETXT1  :King: Connor, my boy!  You have returned to Alutha at last!]
[S43_ETXT2  :Roland: Your first words are for Connor, and not me?]
[S43_ETXT3  :King: Roland, still your heart.  This is a time for memories.  I fear we will have little left to remind us of what we once were when the wave crashes once more.]
[S43_ETXT4  :Roland: So the Golem have arrived?]
[S43_ETXT5  :King: A night ago.  We defeated them... barely.  They will return soon, I fear.]
[S43_ETXT6  :Elya: Was Kraith with them?]
[S43_ETXT7  :King: Kraith?]
[S43_ETXT8  :Roland: The man who called himself "The Creator."]
[S43_ETXT9  :King: Yes.  He was at their rear, mocking, laughing his terrible laugh.]
[S43_ETXT10 :Connor: History repeats itself...]
[S43_ETXT11 :Guard: They have returned.  The Creator wishes to parley at the gate.]
[S43_ETXT12 :King: Very well.]
[S43_ETXT13 :Roland: Archers could kill him where he stands!]
[S43_ETXT14 :Elya: Doubtful.  His arts are quite numerous and quite powerful.]
[S43_ETXT15 :Kraith: KING OF ALUTHA!]
[S43_ETXT16 :King: I hear you, dog.]
[S43_ETXT17 :Kraith: Dog!  Kee kee!  A loyal dog I am not, not to you, no, kee kee, I shall bite your hand if you try to feed me again!  But loyal am I to another, kee kee!  To me!]
[S43_ETXT18 :King: What do you want?]
[S43_ETXT19 :Kraith: The castle!  Leave, but leave, just leave is all!  Kee kee!  Walk, walk, walk away and stay, and live to last another day!  The castle is all you need to give, Kingling!]
[S43_ETXT20 :King: Why should I trust you?]
[S43_ETXT21 :Kraith: Trust!  Kee kee!  Fear me, that's enough!  Open and flee, or stay and die.]
[S43_ETXT22 :King: We will not surrender!]
[S43_ETXT23 :Kraith: Kee kee kee!  More blood then!]
[S43_ETXT24 :King: Quickly, you must help guard the gate.]
[S43_ETXT25 :Roland: Damn, there are too many coming.  We need to hold them at the next door.]
[S43_ETXT26 :Connor: Roland, we've been cut off!  Meet at the top.  Your father must be protected.]
[S43_ETXT27 :Victor: They're falling back!  Ha!]
[S43_ETXT28 :Elya: While we have a moment, let me heal our wounds.]
[S43_ETXT29 :Roland: Not again!]
[S43_ETXT30 :Victor: Ha!  Even that Golem can't stop us!]
[S43_ETXT31 :Elya: No... we hardly scratched the thing.  Something is wrong.]
[S43_ETXT32 :King: You have saved us!]
[S43_ETXT33 :Elya: Perhaps...]
[S43_ETXT34 :Roland: You think the Geist Cannon?]
[S43_ETXT35 :Connor: No, he could've used that with the Golem here.  He didn't want to kill us... he just wanted something in the castle.]
[S43_ETXT36 :King: No... guards!  Check the crypt!]
[S43_ETXT37 :Roland: What is it, father?]
[S43_ETXT38 :King: Three hundred years ago, a war was fought with a terrible demon, whose name was so foul it could not be spoken.]
[S43_ETXT39 :Connor: The Unnamed.]
[S43_ETXT40 :King: Yes.  Three warriors emerged to combat the Unnamed: Alutha, Selera, and Gilus.  They fought many battles, eventually facing the demon in its island castle, the Great Dark.  Though they killed the Unnamed, its taint had infected them all.]
[S43_ETXT41 :Elya: What do you mean?]
[S43_ETXT42 :King: The Unnamed was so powerful, it could implant its soul within their bodies.  So long as any portion of its soul remained, it would endure.]
[S43_ETXT43 :King: Gilus and Selera knew that their people lived too long to control the dark soul within them.  By the time they died natural deaths, they would be wholly under the control of the Unnamed.]
[S43_ETXT44 :King: Alutha alone was strong enough, and short-lived enough, to survive the possession.  Thus, it was up to him to return to the world and to keep its people ever vigilant.  In his name have we Aluthans endured suffering, always keeping courage close to our hearts and swords close to our hands.]
[S43_ETXT45 :Connor: What does that all mean?]
[S43_ETXT46 :King: You will see.  You will learn.]
[S43_ETXT47 :Elya: Some things...]
[S43_ETXT48 :Guard: The corpse of Alutha has been taken!  The rest of the crypt was left untouched.]
[S43_ETXT49 :King: I suspected as much.  I knew it.]
[S43_ETXT50 :Roland: What, father?]
[S43_ETXT51 :King: Kraith is a servant of the Unnamed.  The evil that remains trapped in Alutha's body may allow him to bring the Unnamed back to our world.]
[S43_ETXT52 :Victor: How can a corpse help him?]
[S43_ETXT53 :King: I don't...]
[S43_ETXT54 :Elya: A corpse can't.  A living body can.  And with the Soul Gem, Kraith will be able to restore Alutha's body to a mockery of life.  And with that body, and that Gem, and his already substantial magical arts, he will be able to draw the Unnamed into the body and unleash him once more upon the world.]
[S43_ETXT55 :Connor: Damn it!]
[S43_ETXT56 :King: All our suffering... for nothing.]
[S43_ETXT57 :Victor: So we've lost...]
[S43_ETXT58 :Elya: No.  I said WITH the Soul Gem.  It seems you have forgotten that the Soul Gem is not in Kraith's possession.  The Magi guard it.  And our tower is impregnable to attack.  A magical barrier can be raised to guard it from entry.]
[S43_ETXT59 :Victor: Plus there's that stupid cavern.]
[S43_ETXT60 :King: You must protect the Soul Gem!]
[S43_ETXT61 :Roland: But... what about Alutha?  What about our people?]
[S43_ETXT62 :King: My arms are not so tired that I cannot still raise a sword in defense of my home.  Go, my son.  I shall make sure there is life here yet when you return.  You ensure that our battle here is not in vain.]
[S43_ETXT63 :Connor: To the Tower, then!]

[S44_ETXT1  :Victor: Well, well, well.]
[S44_ETXT2  :Ryan: Hey guys... I hope everything's going well?]
[S44_ETXT3  :Connor: You vulture!  Every time disaster strikes, there you are.]
[S44_ETXT4  :Ryan: You could say the same thing about any hero, couldn't you?  After all, how is it that you end up at every battle?]
[S44_ETXT5  :Ryan: I just come by -- like a doctor -- to help fix things up afterwards.  And right now, it seems like things could use some fixing.]
[S44_ETXT6  :Elya: So how much are you going to demand this time?]
[S44_ETXT7  :Ryan: Oh.. you pierce my heart, really.  I'm doing this from the goodness of my heart.  And my heart needs energy from food... and food costs money.]
[S44_ETXT8  :Victor: A twerp like you can't eat much!]
[S44_ETXT9  :Ryan: Fair enough, but not all of us can subsist on dog food.]
[S44_ETXT10 :Victor: Why you...!]
[S44_ETXT11 :Connor: STOP!]
[S44_ETXT12 :Roland: This is your band of heroes, Connor?  Really... I thought you could do better.  You must have lost some of your charm.]
[S44_ETXT13 :Ryan: Ya know what they say: when you're saving the world, it's okay to take a dogman with you.]
[S44_ETXT14 :Victor: I'll KILL YOU!]
[S44_ETXT15 :Ryan: Aww... I bet your bark is worse than your bite...]
[S44_ETXT16 :Elya: No more.  We go now to the Tower of Magi.  The great tapestry of the world is unravelling while you bicker like children.]
[S44_ETXT17 :Ryan: Can't you do that little teleportation trick?]
[S44_ETXT18 :Elya: No, such are not my arts.]
[S44_ETXT19 :Victor: And who'd want to miss the sea air, anyway?]
[S44_ETXT20 :Ryan: Hey, I might get to like you after all, Rover!]

[S45_ETXT1  :Ryan: I'll wait here.]
[S45_ETXT2  :Victor: Uh-uh.  I don't trust you.]
[S45_ETXT3  :Ryan: Oh, so what are you gonna do?  Really?  Try and make me stay?  Need I remind that I have a crew of bloodthirsty pirates...]
[S45_ETXT4  :Elya: Who we beat easily last time we faced them.  But we'll trust you this time, Ryan.  If you're not here when we come back, I'll get the ArchMage to teleport a knife -- right into your head.]
[S45_ETXT5  :Ryan: He... he... he can do that?!?!]
[S45_ETXT6  :Elya: Just test him, if you doubt it.]
[S45_ETXT7  :Ryan: Everyone's gotta be a bully these days.  What's the world come to?]
[S45_ETXT8  :Roland: The apocalypse.]

[S46_ETXT1  :Elya: No... no...]
[S46_ETXT2  :Victor: I'm sorry.  I know... too well...]
[S46_ETXT3  :Roland: This isn't time for tears.  Tears can be shed after blood, not before.  There is an accounting to be reckoned, and I'm eager for it.]
[S46_ETXT4  :Connor: I stand with you on that, Roland.]
[S46_ETXT5  :Roland: This looks like Golem work, does it not?]
[S46_ETXT6  :Elya: But... how could they get in?  The shield is impenetrable!  There's no way... no way... how...]
[S46_ETXT7  :Roland: The Geist Cannon.  Nothing can withstand its might, not even the spells of mighty wizards.  That means... as long as we're in here, we could be killed at any moment.]
[S46_ETXT8  :Victor: Then why don't we leave?]
[S46_ETXT9  :Connor: NO!  We need the Soul Gem.  It may still be here.]
[S46_ETXT10 :Victor: Doubtful.]
[S46_ETXT11 :Elya: No... it's here.  I feel it.  But... so is Kraith.]
[S46_ETXT12 :Roland: All the better, all the better.]
[S46_ETXT13 :Connor: Let's go then.  He's not getting away this time.]
[S46_ETXT14 :Victor: I'm itching to meet that Omega again.  I'd like to sink my claws into him.]
[S46_ETXT15 :Elya: God... watch over us.]
[S46_ETXT16 :Roland: God has forsaken us.  Now is the time for mankind to act for itself, as it did when last the Unnamed reared his head.]
[S46_ETXT17 :Elya: God never forsakes us.  It is He who gives us the hope to fight on.  And now... let us do just that!]

[S47_ETXT1  :ArchMage: I'll... never... give... it... to... you!]
[S47_ETXT2  :Kraith: Kee kee!  You think you can have a choice?  No choice, no voice, no no!  Nothing for you, nowhere to hide, all you can do is lay down and die!]
[S47_ETXT3  :ArchMage: I'm not through yet!]
[S47_ETXT4  :Kraith: Through?  Oh, not through, not dead, not yet, yes yes.  Not yet, but soon!  Soon enough all will be ... through!  Kee kee!  Throughout the whole world, darkness, darkness!]
[S47_ETXT5  :ArchMage: Why?]
[S47_ETXT6  :Kraith: Why?  "Why?" asks the fly.  Kee kee.  I... hate... you.  Life!  I wanted life, life here, there, everywhere!  Trees, flowers, songbirds singing, children dancing, bears playing with rabbits, yes yes!]
[S47_ETXT7  :Kraith: But no, you said, no, you refused, you threw me out!  Threw?  Through!  You said I was through, now you are through.  No life!  No more life!  Life is wrong... then... death!  Death is right!]
[S47_ETXT8  :ArchMage: Then... DIE!]
[S47_ETXT9  :Kraith: Little heroes, little heroes, in you come!  What will you do?  You are THROUGH!  Kee kee kee!]
[S47_ETXT10 :Kraith: Last time!  Farewell, farewell!  Nothing is left, nothing is left!]
[S47_ETXT11 :Omega: Crush.  Kill.  Destroy.]


[S48_ETXT1  :Omega: Connor... Connor... is that you?  I can't see...]
[S48_ETXT2  :Connor: What?]
[S48_ETXT3  :Omega: My love... is that you?]
[S48_ETXT4  :Connor: An... na?]
[S48_ETXT5  :Omega: Oh Connor... I hurt so much... I hurt...]
[S48_ETXT6  :Connor: ANNA!!!  Noo!  I killed her... I killed... my love.]
[S48_ETXT7  :Elya: No, Connor, she was not your love when you struck her down.  You freed her from her prison.]
[S48_ETXT8  :ArchMage: Help... me... up.]
[S48_ETXT9  :ArchMage: So... powerful...]
[S48_ETXT10 :Elya: Don't worry, I'll heal you.]
[S48_ETXT11 :ArchMage: It's too late, my body is too far gone to be healed.  All that's left is my soul clinging to life.]
[S48_ETXT12 :Elya: But...]
[S48_ETXT13 :ArchMage: Quiet now... you are the last of the Magi.  Listen carefully.]
[S48_ETXT14 :ArchMage: With the Soul Gem, he will be able to bring the Unnamed into this world, but only if he can obtain some remains of the Unnamed... he will need to...]
[S48_ETXT15 :Roland: Too late.  He already has a part.]
[S48_ETXT16 :ArchMage: Then, it's... already over.  I can... but...]
[S48_ETXT17 :Elya: What?]
[S48_ETXT18 :ArchMage: So... little... left.  I will... raise... the three Temples.  They contain three powerful Gems... with them... you may be able to stop Kraith.]
[S48_ETXT19 :Elya: He's...]
[S48_ETXT20 :ArchMage: Not yet.]
[S48_ETXT21 :Connor: We were too late.]
[S48_ETXT22 :Elya: Maybe... with the Gems we can still stop him.]
[S48_ETXT23 :Victor: Somehow I doubt it.]
[S48_ETXT24 :Roland: We must try!  To accept failure is cowardice.  Never have the Aluthans given up, never in our long history.  I will stand now.]
[S48_ETXT25 :Connor: And I.]
[S48_ETXT26 :Elya: It is my duty to the memory of my people.]
[S48_ETXT27 :Victor: And to the memory of mine.]
[S48_ETXT28 :Connor: Then together, let's pay Kraith his due.]

[S48_STXT1  :Ryan: Well, it's about time!  Three temples you say?]
[S48_STXT2  :Ryan: How's this, I'll let you man the ship!  Just press into a land mass if you want to dock.  Easy!]
[S48_STXT3  :Ryan: We should probably stop at a town before we hit the temples.  Now let's go!]

[S48_STXT4  :Elya: Master...]
[S48_STXT5  :Ryan: He won't be needing this.]


[SA_ETXT1   :Connor: Oh God...]
[SA_ETXT2   :Connor: They're all dead... are you happy Roland?]
[SA_ETXT3   :Roland: Happy?  That the world has reached its end?]
[SA_ETXT4   :Roland: My vengeance for your people is exhausted, Connor.  All my emotions are bent toward one man: Kraith.]

[SB_ETXT1   :Connor: What is there left to fight for?]
[SB_ETXT2   :Roland: Revenge.]
[SB_ETXT3   :Elya: As long as there is life left in the world, we must fight on.]

[SG_ETXT1A  :Hassan: Effendi!]
[SG_ETXT1B  :Hassan: Welcome to my new home.  It is a large home, but could use more furniture, yes?]
[SG_ETXT2   :Connor: Hassan?  How are you alive?]
[SG_ETXT3   :Hassan: I am a most resourceful man, am I not, effendi?  I know the ways of the desert like the back of a coin.  This temple was built to honor my greatest of grandfathers, the venerable Sultan Hassan I.  You see, had not your kingdom misunderstood the name of the Oasis, I might be a Sultan still.]
[SG_ETXT4   :Victor: You look more like a merchant than a Sultan to me.]
[SG_ETXT5   :Hassan: Ah, but as we say here in the desert: do not believe it is water until you have tasted it.  In the head, images can shift and change, and true natures become hidden.]
[SG_ETXT6   :Elya: We are here to find a Gem of magical power.]
[SG_ETXT7   :Hassan: Ah yes.  The Sultan Hassan I was a wise man, and a powerful wadji.  It is certain that he possessed such a Gem.  In fact, there is surely such a treasure here.  Yet I must warn you.  This Gem will not come as easily as the last one, effendi.]
[SG_ETXT8   :Connor: Where is it?]
[SG_ETXT9   :Hassan: I do not know.  But know it is in a dangerous place!  Around each corner lurks a monster.]
[SG_ETXT10  :Roland: We can handle it.]
[SG_ETXT11  :Hassan: Yes, but the monsters of this place are monsters of the ages past, trapped in here, hungry, angry.  Be very careful!]
[SG_ETXT12  :Victor: I think you're holding out on us.]
[SG_ETXT13  :Hassan: Effendi, you hurt your friend Hassan.  Please, my humblest apologies, but I have nothing else to give you.  Yet if you are needing a sword, or perhaps a potion, you may find my modest wares to the north of here.]
[SG_ETXT14  :Elya: Let's go.]

[SH_ETXT1   :Ryan: Well... I've never seen this place before.  It's not in any of the maps I've seen.]
[SH_ETXT2   :Elya: The ArchMage raised it from the sea for us.]
[SH_ETXT3   :Ryan: Perhaps it is the legendary city of Pacifica.  An old sea tale says that a bunch of no guts peace-lovers lived in here, until a massive beast called the Kraken came knocking.  The Kraken killed 'em all, ate them up, and then pulled the city into the deep with it.  Doubt it's true, except maybe that bunch of fools lived here.]
[SH_ETXT4   :Elya: Loving peace is not foolish.]
[SH_ETXT5   :Ryan: It is when you've got a sea-monster outside your door.]

[SI_ETXT1   :Victor: That thing is... huge!]
[SI_ETXT2   :Elya: It's long dead.  Creatures like that can't survive in today's world.]
[SI_ETXT3   :Roland: Let's get the Gem.]
[SI_ETXT4   :Victor: Yeah... that thing bothers me.]
[SI_ETXT5   :Victor: "Long dead."]
[SI_ETXT6   :Elya: I... *wheeze* told you... *huff* it couldn't survive in this world!]

[SJ_ETXT1A  :Connor: What is that in the sky?]
[SJ_ETXT1   :Ryan: Whooooah!  That was a close one!]
[SJ_ETXT2   :Elya: Kraith must be using the Geist Cannon.  We don't stand a chance until we have the Gems.]
[SJ_ETXT3   :Roland: That coward!  If only I had a chance to face him!]
[SJ_ETXT4   :Victor: Believe me, we're all dying for the chance.]
[SJ_ETXT5   :Ryan: Well, I think you'll die as soon as you get the chance, so count me out.  Just think of me as Captain Green Mask, not "Mr. Save the World for Kicks."]
[SJ_ETXT6   :Connor: What a surprise.]
[SJ_ETXT7   :Victor: Ryan, you're a coward.]
[SJ_ETXT8   :Ryan: Well, he who dies last, dies best, right?  Now go get those Gems before my boat gets sunk.]
[SJ_ETXT9   :Ryan: We can't go here yet, remember?  Now go get those Gems before my boat gets sunk.]

[SK_ETXT1   :Connor: That's the last of them.]
[SK_ETXT2   :Elya: Now, we can but hope that their power will be sufficient.]
[SK_ETXT3   :Victor: If not, I've got a little something laid aside myself for Kraith.  I'd like to take him out real close, and feel his blood on my hands.]
[SK_ETXT4   :Roland: If there's anything left of him after I'm through, you can run your hands through it all you like.]
[SK_ETXT5   :Connor: Let's not get cocky now.  He has the Geist Cannon defending him, and all of his Golem.  It will take a miracle to succeed.]
[SK_ETXT6   :Roland: Miracles are all we have now, so we should do just fine.]
[SK_ETXT7   :Elya: Truly spoken, Roland.  May God see us through.]
[SK_ETXT8   :Victor: And if he doesn't, to hell with him!]

[S49_ASK1   :Ryan: This is it guys!  We probably will not be able to come back after this.  Are you sure you are ready to go in?]
[S49_ETXT1  :Ryan: Here it comes!  Brace yourselves!]
[S49_ETXT2  :Elya: The power of the Gems protects us!]
[S49_ETXT3  :Ryan: Are you kidding me?!]
[S49_ETXT4  :Ryan: That means as soon as you get off, I'm toast.]
[S49_ETXT5  :Victor: What a shame.]
[S49_ETXT6  :Ryan: What that REALLY means is that as soon as you get off, I'm getting the hell out of here.]
[S49_ETXT7  :Connor: No turning back.]
[S49_ETXT8  :Roland: There never has been.  Destiny only takes you forward.]
[S49_ETXT9  :Ryan: Maybe it pulls you guys forward, but it's taking me back where I came from.  And if you guys don't kill this Kraith jerk, destiny will probably take me dancing around the world for as long as I've got food.]
[S49_ETXT10 :Roland: What a noble sentiment.]
[S49_ETXT11 :Ryan: Hey, tough guy?]
[S49_ETXT12 :Connor: What?]
[S49_ETXT13 :Ryan: Good luck!]
[S49_ETXT14 :Connor: Let's move!]

[S50_ETXT1  :Kraith: How can this be?  Little flies still not swatted?  Well then, you can kill them, my children!]
[S50_ETXT2  :Kraith: Still alive!]
[S50_ETXT3  :Roland: My hate will keep me alive until you're dead.]
[S50_ETXT4  :Kraith: Hate?  You should LOVE!  Good men love, evil men hate.  If you hate, then how are you better than me?  Kee kee!  I should kill YOU!]
[S50_ETXT5  :Victor: You have killed thousands already, demon!]
[S50_ETXT6  :Kraith: Kill one and you're a murderer... kill them all... and you're ME!  Kee kee kee!  I am too strong, too strong for four, poor four, pour forth your blood!]
[S50_ETXT7  :Elya: The spirits of the Magi will give me strength to avenge their deaths.]
[S50_ETXT8  :Connor: Anna... this is for you.]
[S50_ETXT9  :Victor: I am a man, and I will strike you down!]
[S50_ETXT10 :Roland: Alutha will never submit.]
[S50_ETXT11 :Kraith: Kee kee kee!  You are so scary!  But really, it's already too late!  Two late.  One late.  Two became one later.]

[S51_ETXT1  :Kraith: Kee kee... my... blood... was... all... he needed!]
[S51_ETXT2  :Elya: No!]
[S51_ETXT3  :Kraith: Yes!]
[S51_ETXT4  :Unnamed: Fool.]
[S51_ETXT5  :Kraith: Yes!  Fools, all fools!]
[S51_ETXT6  :Unnamed: YOU are the fool, mortal.  You longed for death, but I am not a bringer of death.  I am a bringer of evil.  Your pathetic scheming is nothing compared to what I shall inflict.  I will bring torment without end, suffering that is incomprehensible to the mortal mind.  None shall die, but rather all shall live forever, in eternal hell.]
[S51_ETXT7A :Kraith: NO!  Death!  Kill!  Destroy it all!]
[S51_ETXT7B :Unnamed: Do you think I am some Djinn to do your bidding, mortal?  I could strike you down now, but I shall not.  You five, fool who would revive me, and greater fools who thought they could defeat me: I shall let you live.  Live to watch my evil unfurl.]
[S51_ETXT8  :Kraith: NO!  Come back!  Please...]
[S51_ETXT9  :Victor: It's over.]
[S51_ETXT10 :Roland: Well, I have one thing left to do.]
[S51_ETXT11 :Kraith: How... could this be?  No death... death is... DEAD?  Impossible!  No no no!  Not this, only death may live, yet now only death may die!  It is wrong!  Evil!]
[S51_ETXT12 :Connor: You have only yourself to blame.  But don't worry, you'll die here, now.]
[S51_ETXT13 :Kraith: But... wait!  Wait, yes, all is lost TOMORROW, all is lost TODAY, but all is not lost YESTERDAY!]
[S51_ETXT14 :Victor: Well, then why don't you go back and live in yesterday.]
[S51_ETXT15 :Kraith: YES!  But no!  You will DIE in yesterday, and KILL in yesterday!  Yes!  Kill Alutha!]
[S51_ETXT16 :Connor: What are you talking about?]
[S51_ETXT17 :Kraith: Yesterday makes today!  Yes!  But unmake yesterday, remake today, and gone today is the Unnamed!  Unknown!  Unkill death, unlive the Unnamed, free us!]
[S51_ETXT18 :Elya: You mean... go back in time?  Impossible!]
[S51_ETXT19 :Kraith: No, death is impossible, nothing is impossible, yes, this is something possible!  Kee kee!  One last trick!  Kee kee!]
[S51_ETXT20 :Kraith: In in!  Go go!]
[S51_ETXT21 :Roland: Trust you again?  Never!]
[S51_ETXT22 :Elya: It is the only chance we have.  Even the legendary wizard Gilus was barely able to contain the Unnamed's magic, and at his side fought brave Alutha and Selera.  We are no equal to those heroes.]
[S51_ETXT23 :Kraith: No match!  Kee kee!  Not for all, not at all, but for one, all for one!  Three may kill one!  You will kill Alutha!]
[S51_ETXT24 :Connor: What does he mean?]
[S51_ETXT25 :Elya: We will kill Alutha before he leaves the Great Dark.  We stand here on its ruins.  If we were to go back in time, we could find Alutha and kill him after he kills the Unnamed.]
[S51_ETXT26 :Roland: And thus destroy the kingdom of Alutha?  How ironic.  King Aldric would be pleased.]
[S51_ETXT27 :Connor: Better that we sacrifice these things... so that the world may live.  The kingdom of Alutha may disappear, but its people will survive.]
[S51_ETXT28 :Roland: Indeed.  The Aluthan people are strong.  I will stand beside you in this darkest hour.]
[S51_ETXT29 :Kraith: Kee kee!  Dark indeed!  Greater Dark within!  In in!]
[S51_ETXT30 :Victor: I don't trust him.]
[S51_ETXT31 :Roland: You stay here, kill Kraith when we pass through.]
[S51_ETXT32 :Kraith: Yes, death, death is good!]
[S51_ETXT33 :Victor: Thank you.  I'll relish it.]
[S51_ETXT34 :Elya: Let's go!  If this is a trick...]
[S51_ETXT35 :Connor: Doesn't matter.  We're already dead anyway.]

[S52_ETXT1  :Connor: It... worked!]
[S52_ETXT2  :Roland: This place... chills me to the bones.]
[S52_ETXT3  :Elya: Indeed.  I can sense the evil in each stone.  It is overwhelming.  I... I... I can't go on.]
[S52_ETXT4  :Connor: Yes Elya, you can.  Together, we have the strength.]
[S52_ETXT5  :Roland: You have the best two knights of our age beside you, Elya, and you are its last wizard.  Between us, we represent the hope of all the peoples of the world.]
[S52_ETXT6  :Elya: I...]
[S52_ETXT7  :Connor: Shh.  Don't talk.  Just trust in yourself.]

[S53_ETXT1  :Elya: Oh... the evil... it's getting stronger.]
[S53_ETXT2  :Connor: Even I can feel it now.]
[S53_ETXT3  :Roland: Hold on to your hate!  Let your anger carry you forward.]
[S53_ETXT4  :Elya: NO!  No, the Unnamed cannot be defeated with hate.  We must remember we are acting to save, not to kill.]
[S53_ETXT5  :Roland: We're not here to kill the Unnamed, we're here to kill my ancestor.]
[S53_ETXT6  :Elya: No, don't you see?  If you come in here with a weak heart, he will take it.  We cannot allow the Unnamed to pass from Alutha into us.  We must be strong.]
[S53_ETXT7  :Connor: Think of Anna, Roland.]
[S53_ETXT8  :Roland: Think of Anna and not be filled with rage?  Easier that I think of Kraith!]
[S53_ETXT9  :Elya: Think of your father, then.  Think of the love he still holds in his heart, despite all the evil that has been done to him.  We must kill for love, not for hatred.]
[S53_ETXT10 :Roland: I... my... my father is too good for me.]
[S53_ETXT11 :Connor: Roland, you have surpassed all others with your skill at the sword.  Now, you need but be a knight in your heart.]
[S53_ETXT12 :Roland: Very well.  Trust in me.  I shall not fail.]
[S53_ETXT13 :Elya: Then... let's hurry.]

[S54_ETXT1  :Selera: I'm... wounded.]
[S54_ETXT2  :Gilus: Engulf!]
[S54_ETXT3  :Alutha: GILUS!  SELERA!]
[S54_ETXT4  :Alutha: This... is for my friends!  For everyone who you've ruined!]
[S54_ETXT5  :Selera: You... you did it, my love!]
[S54_ETXT6  :Gilus: Something is wrong... the evil isn't disappearing.  I still feel it.]
[S54_ETXT7  :Selera: I can feel it too...]
[S54_ETXT8  :Alutha: Inside me...]
[S54_ETXT9  :Gilus: NO!  He's infected us with his taint!  Just like he did to turn the people of Finargin into his slaves!]
[S54_ETXT10 :Alutha: So even in victory, we are defeated.]
[S54_ETXT11 :Gilus: Alutha, you must kill us!]
[S54_ETXT12 :Alutha: No...]
[S54_ETXT13 :Selera: Please, my love, you must.]
[S54_ETXT14 :Alutha: I cannot.]
[S54_ETXT15 :Gilus: You must!  He has touched us all.  If you allow us to live, we will be turned... you alone have the strength to endure.]
[S54_ETXT16 :Alutha: NO!  Not this.  Anything but this.]
[S54_ETXT17 :Selera: My love, there can be nothing else.  You must return to make sure the world is kept safe, and we must die to ensure that He does not survive.  You must protect our child.]
[S54_ETXT18 :Alutha: My love...]
[S54_ETXT19 :Gilus: Now!  Before it is too late!]
[S54_ETXT20 :Selera: Let your love guide your hand.]
[S54_ETXT21 :Alutha: What have I done?  What sin have I committed to earn this torment?]
[S54_ETXT22 :Connor: We need to hurry, before he escapes!]
[S54_ETXT23 :Roland: So that... is our sin.]
[S54_ETXT24 :Connor: Come on!]

[S55_ETXT1  :Alutha: Who are you?]
[S55_ETXT2  :Connor: We need to kill you.]
[S55_ETXT3  :Alutha: What?  What are you talking about?  Are you His servants?]
[S55_ETXT4  :Elya: You must let us kill you, or everything you have fought for is for nothing.]
[S55_ETXT5  :Alutha: Explain yourselves!]
[S55_ETXT6  :Roland: We are from your future.  You will return to your kingdom, and make it proud and mighty.  But hatred will consume our nation, and Selera's...]
[S55_ETXT7  :Alutha: Impossible!  We loved each other.]
[S55_ETXT8  :Roland: I have lived that hatred!  It will happen!  In that chaos, your body will be stolen, used to return the Unnamed to our world.  And none will be strong enough to oppose him.  Already, when we left, most of the world was destroyed.]
[S55_ETXT9  :Roland: If we had stayed, we would merely have borne witness to the end of what little remained.  But know that our people were among the strongest.]
[S55_ETXT10 :Alutha: LIES!  He was ever the King of Lies.  I will not submit.  I will return and make a peace that shall endure forever.]
[S55_ETXT11 :Connor: With Selera's blood fresh on your blade?  Your history has already been written, Alutha.  The only choice we have is to ensure you have no more history at all.]
[S55_ETXT12 :Elya: Trust us!]
[S55_ETXT13 :Alutha: Never!  I do not submit, I do not surrender.  My strength will carry me on.  Now stand aside.]
[S55_ETXT14 :Roland: That pride is what destroyed us, Alutha.]
[S55_ETXT15 :Alutha: Stand aside!]
[S55_ETXT16 :Roland: I cannot.  We cannot.  It is the only hope for the world.]
[S55_ETXT17 :Alutha: Stand aside, or die on my blade.]
[S55_ETXT18 :Roland: We are the same, Alutha.  Neither of us will yield.  Only there are three of us, and but one of you.]
[S55_ETXT19 :Alutha: I have killed the Unnamed.  Do you think that three of His slaves are enough to defeat me?]

[S56_ETXT1  :Alutha: How is this possible?]
[S56_ETXT2  :Roland: The same blood pumps through our veins, Alutha.  Let's cease this foolishness.]
[S56_ETXT3  :Alutha: You will not let me live, I will not kill myself.]
[S56_ETXT4  :Elya: Look!]
[S56_ETXT5  :Elya: The portal home... it's already gone.]
[S56_ETXT6  :Connor: How?]
[S56_ETXT7  :Elya: The past has already been irreversibly changed.]
[S56_ETXT8  :Roland: So now we all die here.]
[S56_ETXT9  :Elya: Perhaps there is a way.  We must not lose hope.  Let us search the citadel.]
[S56_ETXT10 :Alutha: I will fight at your side, for our foe is the same.]

[S57_ETXT1  :Connor: I suppose... this is the only way?]
[S57_ETXT2  :Roland: Always forward.  It is either through here or wait for death: the same choice we faced on the island.]
[S57_ETXT3  :Elya: He is correct.  I sense this portal is different from the others, however.  It does not merely pass through time...]
[S57_ETXT4  :Connor: Well, we have no choice.]

[S58_ETXT1  :Anna: Good morning, my love.]
[S58_ETXT2  :Connor: Anna?]
[S58_ETXT3  :Anna: I've been waiting for you.]
[S58_ETXT4  :Connor: Is this heaven?]
[S58_ETXT5  :Anna: Heaven?  It is heaven to be with you, my angel.]
[S58_ETXT6  :Connor: Wha... what day is this?]
[S58_ETXT7  :Anna: It is the sixteenth.]
[S58_ETXT8  :Connor: What month, what year?!]
[S58_ETXT9  :Anna: What's wrong, Connor?  You must've been having a nightmare.]
[S58_ETXT10 :Connor: Please, just tell me.]
[S58_ETXT11 :Anna: July, 641.]
[S58_ETXT12 :Connor: Oh God... no... just one more day...]
[S58_ETXT13 :Anna: The same day it has been, and shall remain, forever.]
[S58_ETXT14 :Connor: What do you mean?]
[S58_ETXT15 :Anna: You'll see.  Go visit your friends, I'll be waiting for you.  I've been waiting for a long time, I can wait a bit longer.]

[S59_ETXT1  :Connor: Where am I?]
[S59_ETXT2  :Boy: You are within your Joyous Day, Connor.  This is where you will stay.  Those who leave space and time come here, to live out their happiest moment for eternity.]
[S59_ETXT3  :Connor: Is this Heaven?]
[S59_ETXT4  :Boy: It is YOUR Heaven, Connor.  We are only here for your sake.]
[S59_ETXT5  :Connor: But what about the Plague, the War...?]
[S59_ETXT6  :Boy: None of that has happened here, nor ever will happen.  This is a moment of joy.]
[S59_ETXT7  :Boy: What's happening?]
[S59_ETXT8  :Connor: Don't you know?!]
[S59_ETXT9  :Boy: I'm scared!]

[S60_ETXT1  :Anna: What's happening, Connor?]
[S60_ETXT2  :Connor: I don't know.]
[S60_ETXT3  :Anna: Why is this happening?]
[S60_ETXT4  :Connor: I... I need to find out, Anna.]
[S60_ETXT5  :Connor: Anna...]
[S60_ETXT6  :Anna: What is it?]
[S60_ETXT7  :Connor: I need to go through.  Will you come with me?]
[S60_ETXT8  :Anna: I only exist here, Connor.  I only exist while you're here.  If you leave... I will be gone.]
[S60_ETXT9  :Connor: My love!]
[S60_ETXT10 :Anna: But, Connor... I know your heart.  You cannot live in a fantasy forever.  Step through.  Be strong for me.  Remember me.]
[S60_ETXT11 :Connor: Anna, I can't leave!]
[S60_ETXT12 :Anna: Don't you see, Connor?  As long as you remember me, our Day will last forever in your soul.  We'll be together until all else ends.]
[S60_ETXT13 :Connor: Anna...]
[S60_ETXT14 :Anna: Go through.]

[S61_ETXT1  :Connor: Where... where am I now?]

[S62_STXT1  :Anna: Who's the other boy with you?  He looks nice.]

[S62_ETXT1  :Girl: Roland!  No fair!  You got to be the hero yesterday!  It's my turn today!]
[S62_ETXT2  :Roland: That's because I'm the BOY, Anna!]
[S62_ETXT3  :Girl: No fair!]
[S62_ETXT4  :Connor: Rol... Roland?]
[S62_ETXT5  :Roland: Who are you?]
[S62_ETXT6  :Connor: These Joyous Days aren't real, Roland.  There is something more important happening.]
[S62_ETXT7  :Roland: I don't know who you are, go away!]
[S62_ETXT8  :Connor: Yes you do, Roland.  We're brothers.  Don't hide... it's not like you.  You have never hidden from a fight.]
[S62_ETXT9  :Roland: You're right.]
[S62_ETXT10 :Girl: Roland?]
[S62_ETXT11 :Roland: I'll see you again, Anna, I promise.  But for now, I've got a job to do.  Keep safe... and... be careful, okay?  I don't want you getting hurt while I'm gone.]
[S62_ETXT12 :Anna: I won't!  Who's the other boy with you?  He looks nice.]
[S62_ETXT13 :Roland: You've always thought that, Anna.  You'll meet him again some day.  Until then... remember me.]
[S62_ETXT14 :Roland: Come on.  Where do we go now?]

[S63_ETXT1  :Roland: Where will this one take us?]
[S63_ETXT2  :Connor: I don't know.]
[S63_ETXT3  :Roland: These days are disappearing... turning into night.]
[S63_ETXT4  :Connor: I know.  Something is wrong.]
[S63_ETXT5  :Roland: Let's go.]

[S64_ETXT1  :Elya: I was waiting for you.]
[S64_ETXT2  :Connor: How... what... is happening?  What are you doing here, Alutha?]
[S64_ETXT3  :Alutha: She brought me here.]
[S64_ETXT4  :Elya: The Joyous Days are the resting places of souls that have been cast out of space and time.  By interfering with the past, we changed our futures, so that we no longer exist in that time.  If all were right, we should stay in these Days forever.]
[S64_ETXT5  :Roland: But these portals are appearing?]
[S64_ETXT6  :Elya: I created the portals.  The darkness falling here is a shadow cast by the Unnamed.  He has somehow crept into the Joyous Days.  From here, He can destroy all happy memories for all who have ever lived, or ever will live, turning the Days into Grievious Nights.]
[S64_ETXT7  :Connor: How can we stop him?]
[S64_ETXT8  :Elya: There is one more portal, at the top of the Tower.  Passing through it will bring us to His Day, where we must face Him.  If we can destroy Him there, He will be destroyed utterly:  no trace of Him will remain in any past, any future, any present.]
[S64_ETXT9  :Roland: And if we fail?]
[S64_ETXT10 :Elya: Then we have failed in everything we have fought for, this whole quest.]
[S64_ETXT11 :Connor: Then we shall not fail!]
[S64_ETXT12 :Elya: Be wary!  All is not as it seems here... He has already corrupted my Joyous Day entirely.  It is a reflection of the chaos within His evil.]
[S64_ETXT13 :Roland: My sword will be ready.]

[S65_ETXT1  :Elya: Are you ready?  Beyond this there is only suffering.]
[S65_ETXT2  :Roland: All my life, I dreamed of facing a legendary evil, proving the worth of my people.  Now I have the chance.]
[S65_ETXT3  :Connor: Our hope shall see us through.]
[S65_ETXT4  :Alutha: Selera gave her life to destroy the Unnamed.  May her soul give me strength.]
[S65_ETXT5  :Elya: God watch over us.]

[S66_ETXT1  :Connor: We've come to destroy you at last, demon!]
[S66_ETXT2  :Unnamed: Of course.  Yet what gives you mortals the right to bring war to me?  I am driven by motives no different from yours.]
[S66_ETXT3  :Roland: Liar!  You are the King of Lies.  Your motives are foul: inflicting pain; ruining hopes; crushing dreams!]
[S66_ETXT4  :Unnamed: Yet you would crush my dreams, would you not?  Ruin my hopes?  You ruined the hopes of the fool Kraith.  Each of us has dreams, and we struggle fiercely to achieve them.  What makes yours just, and mine unjust?]
[S66_ETXT5  :Connor: You have killed hundreds for your dream!  Your dream destroys all others!]
[S66_ETXT6  :Unnamed: And yours has not?  How many thousands of souls did you force into the Joyous Day by rewriting history?  How many creatures did you kill along the way to facing me?  All these "monsters" as you deem them had dreams, did they not?  All the humans in your present, all those who would exist in that future, whose future you stole -- are their dreams not ruined?]
[S66_ETXT7  :Connor: We acted to stop you!]
[S66_ETXT8  :Unnamed: Ahhh... so your dreams take precedence over theirs?  Come then:  I will grant you your dreams.  Connor, return to Anna.  Elya, gloat over the chauvanist Magi who denied you a place in their ranks.  Roland, live your childhood for eternity.  I shall leave your Days untouched.  And Alutha... even Selera could be brought back.  The rest shall be ground to dust.]
[S66_ETXT9  :Elya: To betray my conscience... that would ruin any joy I could ever feel.]
[S66_ETXT10 :Unnamed: Come now, don't be a fool, girl!  You have all betrayed your consciences already.  You allowed Victor to live, when you knew he was a threat to you all.]
[S66_ETXT11 :Unnamed: Alutha, the man of honor, of might... how easily you stepped aside and allowed your own destruction.  Yes: destruction.  You shall never go home again.]
[S66_ETXT12 :Unnamed: Roland, you gave up your revenge against Connor, against Kraith, against Selera, betraying everything you lived for.]
[S66_ETXT13 :Unnamed: And Connor!  Oh, Connor, you betrayed Anna, you betrayed Roland, you betrayed yourself when you allowed Aldric to lock you in your home.  You sat there and lived happily with your wife while Alutha was ruined.]
[S66_ETXT14 :Unnamed: Don't tell me that you have stayed true -- that is but one more lie in your long litany of falsehoods.]
[S66_ETXT15 :Connor: We have changed our minds, yes!  That is part of life!  But the "betrayals" you speak of were for the good.  Our souls came to peace.  We turned away from hatred, from mistrust, from violence.  This promise of yours is the greatest lie!  There will be no "Joyous Dream."  I cannot return to Anna having turned my back on everything our love stood for.]
[S66_ETXT16 :Roland: I have let go of vengeance, so that I may be pure of heart when I destroy you, demon!]
[S66_ETXT17 :Elya: I have learned it is wrong to judge others... yet you have judged yourself, Unnamed.  Now face your punishment.]
[S66_ETXT18 :Alutha: I have given up everything, but in the name of peace.  That is what a true warrior must do.]
[S66_ETXT19 :Unnamed: You will not turn aside?  Then fall before me!]
[S66_ETXT20 :Anna: Connor...]
[S66_ETXT21 :Selera: Alutha...]
[S66_ETXT22 :Anna: Your love calls out to us, across the void, against the darkness.]
[S66_ETXT23 :Unnamed: How... can... it be?  My powers... are... diminished.  I am made mortal!]
[S66_ETXT24 :Connor: And now you shall die.]
[S66_ETXT25 :Unnamed: I still have power enough to defeat you fools!]


** Ending **
[S67_ETXT1  :Victor: Now, look, you need to feel the Wood around you, hear its calls and smell its scents.  You'll all be Guides too, some day.  Better ones than me, I'm sure!]
[S67_ETXT2  :Boy: Impossible!]
[S67_ETXT3  :Victor: Anything is possible.]

[S68_ETXT1  :Merchant: Five... five... five thousand aurum?!  That's robbery!]
[S68_ETXT2  :Ryan: Well, that's what it's gonna cost ya, so pay up or shut up.]
[S68_ETXT3  :Merchant: You would make a better pirate than a merchant!]
[S68_ETXT4  :Ryan: Wouldn't I though?]

[S69_ETXT1  :Girl: Archmage!  I think I finally mastered the Engulf spell!]
[S69_ETXT2  :Elya: Congratulations, Cecille!  I can't wait to see what else you'll learn.  If you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything.]

[S70_ETXT1  :Man: Grow, grow, ho ho!  Life is good, life I should...]
[S70_ETXT2  :Man: Or... maybe... death is good!  Kill kill!]
[S70_ETXT3  :Man: Nah.  Life is better.]

[S71_ETXT1  :Roland: Somewhere... my destiny is waiting for me.  I will find an enemy powerful enough to prove my mettle.  Then, all the world will know of my people's strength.]

[S72_ETXT1  :Connor: Anna?  Anna.. is that you?]
[S72_ETXT2  :Connor: Who could be... what is going on?  Was it all a dream?  A nightmare?  Or is this another Joyous Day?]
[S72_ETXT3  :Connor: Who is it?]
[S72_ETXT4  :Connor: My love!]


[S0A_ETXT1  :Woman: Please, my love, you must.]
[S0A_ETXT2  :Knight: I cannot.]
[S0A_ETXT3  :Wizard: You must!  He has touched us all.  If you allow us to live, we will be turned... you alone have the strength th endure.]
[S0A_ETXT4  :Knight: NO!  Not this.  Anything but this.]
[S0A_ETXT5  :Woman: My love, there can be nothing else.  You must return to make sure the world is kept safe, and we must die to ensure that He does not survive.  You must protect our child.]
[S0A_ETXT6  :Knight: My love...]
[S0A_ETXT7  :Wizard: Now!  Before it is too late!]
[S0A_ETXT8  :Woman: Let your love guide your hand.]
[S0A_ETXT9  :Knight: My love, what have I done?]
